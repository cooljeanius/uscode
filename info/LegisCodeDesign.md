Goal: figure out how to write the language used in legislation into a programming language (LegisCode). Languages to use for inspiration:


- LOLcode, for its top-down design philosophy of aiming to recreate a certain linguistic dialect programmatically as its primary goal, over and above any other concerns
- AppleScript, for its natural language syntax
- COBOL, for its large number of reserved words (but ***not*** for any other part of the language though)
- C, because I've actually taken a class in it, so it's probably the language I know the best (besides shell scripting but that doesn't count) 


There is also a “Hello World” example in this repository called "LegisCode.txt", it has more design notes included in it.
