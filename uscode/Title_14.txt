-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch.
    20, Sec. 1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, Secs. 5, 6(a), 55
    Stat. 585).
      Said section has been divided. Provisions relating to operation
    under the Navy in time of war are placed in sections 3 and 4 of
    this title, and the remainder is in this section.
      This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and
    branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. By
    the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 1), the Coast Guard was constituted a branch of the land and
    naval forces of the United States at all times. This section
    therefore merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing
    law on the military status of the Coast Guard, substituting "armed
    forces" for "land and naval forces" because of the recent
    establishment of the Department of the Air Force as an "armed
    force" rather than as a part of the "land and naval forces". The
    Coast Guard is designated a service in the Treasury Department
    except when operating as a service in the Navy. This is a better
    definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines
    it as a service under the Treasury Department in time of peace,

      This section contains a codification of functions. It sets forth
    in general language the primary responsibilities of the Coast
    Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have
    application, safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation,
    and readiness to function with the Navy. Having been created in
    1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the
    Life Saving Service, the Coast Guard has gradually been given
    additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of
    law enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in
    1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in 1939, and the
    transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942.
    Existing along with these other duties has been that of maintaining
    a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active
    participation with the Navy in time of war. These various
    interdependent functions of the Service have not been expressed
    collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed
    desirable to do so in this revision in order to have outlined in
    general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of
    the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

    6 (a), 55 Stat. 585).
      Subsection (c) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 7
    (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 600).
      Subsection (d) is derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs.
    355 to 356b (Feb. 4, 1919, ch. 14, Secs. 2-5, 40 Stat. 1056; Aug.
    7, 1942, ch. 551, Sec. 1, 56 Stat. 743).
      Said sections authorized medals for presentation ". . . to any
    person who, while serving in any capacity with the Navy of the
    United States . . ."; inasmuch as this language includes the Coast
    Guard when it is operating under the Navy, this subsection entails
    no change in existing law.
      Subsection (e) is based on title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 228
    (R.S. 1442; Feb. 28, 1942, ch. 11, 59 Stat. 9).
      Inasmuch as R.S. 1442 cited above applies to the Navy and Marine
    Corps as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but
    is being amended by section 6 of this act to eliminate reference to
    the Coast Guard.
      Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 3
    (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 600).
      Said section has been divided. The provisions concerning
    applicability of Navy laws to Coast Guard personnel are placed in
    this section. The provisions of the provisos of title 14, U.S.C.,
    1946 ed., Sec. 3 are placed in section 571 of this title.
      Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No.

    Stat. 410; May 19, 1948, ch. 305, 62 Stat. 239).
      Said sections have been divided. The provisions of the proviso of
    title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 11a, and the first proviso of
    title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 12, are placed in section 48 of
    this title and the remainder is placed in this section.
      The provisions regarding appointment of the Assistant Commandant
    and Engineer in Chief are coordinated, inasmuch as these positions
    are about equal in the Coast Guard organization. The qualification
    that the Engineer in Chief be appointed from the active list of
    engineering officers is changed to the active list of officers who
    have qualified for engineering duty, because there is no longer any
    provision for a corps of engineering officers. 81st Congress, House
    Report No. 557.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Coast Guard may make inquiries, examinations,
    inspections, searches, seizures, and arrests upon the high seas and
    waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, for the
    prevention, detection, and suppression of violations of laws of the
    United States. For such purposes, commissioned, warrant, and petty
    officers may at any time go on board of any vessel subject to the
    jurisdiction, or to the operation of any law, of the United States,
    address inquiries to those on board, examine the ship's documents
    and papers, and examine, inspect, and search the vessel and use all
    necessary force to compel compliance. When from such inquiries,
    examination, inspection, or search it appears that a breach of the
    laws of the United States rendering a person liable to arrest is
    being, or has been committed, by any person, such person shall be
    arrested or, if escaping to shore, shall be immediately pursued and
    arrested on shore, or other lawful and appropriate action shall be
    taken; or, if it shall appear that a breach of the laws of the
    United States has been committed so as to render such vessel, or
    the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board of, or brought into
    the United States by, such vessel, liable to forfeiture, or so as
    to render such vessel liable to a fine or penalty and if necessary
    to secure such fine or penalty, such vessel or such merchandise, or
    both, shall be seized.
      (b) The officers of the Coast Guard insofar as they are engaged,
    pursuant to the authority contained in this section, in enforcing
    any law of the United States shall:
        (1) be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular
      executive department or independent establishment charged with
      the administration of the particular law; and
        (2) be subject to all the rules and regulations promulgated by
      such department or independent establishment with respect to the
      enforcement of that law.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      This section grants broad general powers concerning policy
    matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers are contained in
    existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are
    added as explained following.
      Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 95
    (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been
    divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations
    seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the
    Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in
    section 93(c) of this title.
      Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 28,
    42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742,
    Sec. 11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to
    broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard
    personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a
    practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of
    Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually
    satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.
      Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C.,
    1946 ed., Secs. 29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch.
    117, Sec. 2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601;
    June 6, 1940, ch. 257, Sec. 4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502,
    61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it
    provides general legislative authority for the construction and
    disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation
    stations.
      Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Secs. 55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Secs. 487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265,
    Sec. 3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This
    subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general
    legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by
    other means, and disposal of vessels.
      Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946
    ed., Sec. 31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was
    originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, Sec.
    602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, Sec.
    6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of
    vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to
    vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should
    prove advantageous to the Government.
      Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 96
    and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3,
    1875, ch. 130, Sec. 1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35
    Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, Sec. 9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4,
    1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power
    of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for
    stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided
    it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the
    Coast Guard.
      Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, Sec. 2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11,
    1941, ch. 290, Sec. 1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the
    Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment
    for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties
    and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of
    past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.
      Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may
    exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.
      Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Secs. 51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may
    do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.
      Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No.

      Pub. L. 107-295, title III, Sec. 345, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat.
    2106, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses. One
      hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the State
      of Michigan.
        "(2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture
      and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the
      region's political, economic, and social history.
        "(3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great
      Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In Michigan alone, approximately 70
      lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal
      Government and will be transferred to the General Services
      Administration for disposal.
        "(4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is
      confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of
      historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit
      organizations. This is especially troubling because, in many
      cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated
      tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes
      lighthouses.
        "(5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be
      unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.
        "(6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed
      Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic
      Places.
      "(b) Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation Efforts. -
     The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating, may - 
        "(1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to
      organizations in the Great Lakes region that are dedicated to
      lighthouse stewardship; and
        "(2) promptly release information regarding the timing of
      designations of Coast Guard lighthouses on the Great Lakes as
      excess to the needs of the Coast Guard, to enable those
      organizations to mobilize and be prepared to take appropriate
      action with respect to the disposal of those properties."

    communications services to place commercial VHF communications
    equipment on real property under the administrative control of the
    Coast Guard (including towers) subject to any terms agreed to by

    service provider also may enter into an agreement providing for VHF
    communications services to the Coast Guard (including digital
    selective calling and radio direction finding services) at a
    discounted rate or price based on providing such access to real
    property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard.
      "(b) Commercial VHF communication equipment placed on real
    property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard under
    this section shall not interfere in any manner with any current or
    future Coast Guard communication equipment.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      This section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in
    general, operations within the Service and the internal functioning
    of the Service. Many of the powers are contained in existing law,
    but some are enlarged, and some additional powers are added as
    explained following.
      Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec.
    53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 471 (R.S. 1536). The
    authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in
    the operational head of the Service, and not in the President. This
    section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day
    cruising and patrolling.
      Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C.,
    1946 ed., Secs. 29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4,
    1882, ch. 117, Secs. 2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39
    Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch.
    257, Sec. 4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the
    Commandant authority in regard to the establishment,
    discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments
    other than Coast Guard districts. This power must exist inherently
    in order for the Service to function efficiently.
      Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs.
    54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, Sec. 3, 22 Stat. 56; May 30,
    1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, Sec. 2, 36
    Stat. 326), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in
    regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation,
    and other equipment. This power is inherent to the proper
    functioning of any Service.
      Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 91
    (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, Sec. 7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10, 1921, ch.
    18, Sec. 304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, Sec. 9, 44 Stat.
    817). Said section has been divided. The part dealing with
    investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection
    in broader terms, and the other parts are covered in general terms
    in section 632 of this title.
      Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 111
    (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, Sec. 9, 20 Stat. 164). This section has
    been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any
    investigation or study that may be of assistance to the Coast
    Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been
    eliminated.
      Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative
    recognition to the importance of disseminating information by the
    Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving
    techniques, and other Coast Guard activities.
      Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast
    Guard personnel at other than schools or institutions of the other
    armed forces. Such training is essential and has been carried on
    under the authority of appropriation acts for many years.
      Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Secs. 69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch. 344, Sec. 9, 18
    Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, Sec. 3, 20 Stat. 163), and is
    intended to complement the authority granted to the Secretary in
    sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the
    Commandant as to smaller craft.
      Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., Secs. 108,
    109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 752 (June 20, 1874,
    ch. 344, Sec. 9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, Sec. 3, 20
    Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 10183, and grants power
    to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and
    supplies. The authority with respect to the acceptance of such
    equipment as a gift is new.
      Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to
    operate and maintain shore establishments; previously such
    authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the
    establishment of shore stations; again such authority is inherent
    to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no
    greater authority than has been exercised in the past.
      Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 31b
    (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed
    by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, Sec. 602(a)(28), 63 Stat.
    399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, Sec. 6(a), (b), 64 Stat.
    583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well
    as to the Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an
    operational matter and the items which may be exchanged have been
    enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances,
    equipment, and supplies.
      Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as
    the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended
    by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast
    Guard.
      Subsection (l) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give
    legislative authority for existing yards, and for the procurement
    of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or
    economically obtainable from private contractors.
      Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 110,
    192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, Sec. 6, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878,
    ch. 265, Sec. 10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, Sec. 9, 44
    Stat. 817). The power to accept volunteer services is enlarged to
    include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or
    protect property, and the restrictive provisions relating to
    lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.
      Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to
    lease real property under the control of the Coast Guard, when not
    immediately needed in Coast Guard operations. Such authority will
    be advantageous to the Government, on the basis of past experience.
      Subsection (o) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of
    this section. It grants further authority to the Commandant
    permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under
    control of the Coast Guard. This will avoid the necessity of
    special acts of Congress in each of such instances.
      Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority
    for the maintenance of networks of wires and cables, in some cases
    over or along private property or public highways. These networks
    are in existence at the present time and are essential for the
    Service to carry out its functions.
      Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear
    authority for the maintenance of radio stations which are essential
    to Coast Guard functions.
      Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      In connection with its maritime police, promoting safety of life
    and property at sea, and aiding navigation functions, the Coast
    Guard frequently finds it advisable to utilize the services of
    other agencies and correlatively, frequently finds its facilities
    useful to other agencies. This high degree of cooperation, a
    natural attribute of a producing and servicing agency, is important
    not only because it greatly promotes the quantity and quality of
    the services performed, but because the concentration of these
    functions in one agency results in savings to the Government of man-
    power, funds, and equipment. In the belief that legislative
    recognition of and specific power to continue this needed
    cooperation are desirable, Chapter 7 of this title contains a group
    of sections on cooperation with designated agencies. This is not
    meant to be a complete listing of cooperating agencies, but rather
    the designation of the principal ones. In addition, the first
    section of the chapter deals with availability of Coast Guard
    personnel and facilities to other agencies and the availability of
    other agency personnel and facilities to the Coast Guard. 81st
    Congress, House Report No. 557.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Coast Guard may, when so requested by proper authority,
    utilize its personnel and facilities (including members of the
    Auxiliary and facilities governed under chapter 23) to assist any
    Federal agency, State, Territory, possession, or political
    subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, to perform any
    activity for which such personnel and facilities are especially
    qualified. The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including
    reimbursement, under which personnel and facilities may be provided
    under this subsection.
      (b) The Coast Guard, with the consent of the head of the agency
    concerned, may avail itself of such officers and employees, advice,
    information, and facilities of any Federal agency, State,
    Territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or the
    District of Columbia as may be helpful in the performance of its
    duties. In connection with the utilization of personal services of
    employees of state or local governments, the Coast Guard may make
    payments for necessary traveling and per diem expenses as
    prescribed for Federal employees by the standardized Government
    travel regulations.

    756 (Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81, Sec. 6, 38 Stat. 928), and authorizes
    the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other
    Government agencies when requested and, correlatively, authorizes
    the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other
    agencies. It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled
    out by statute because in times of emergency, for example floods,
    it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner.

      The Coast Guard, through the Secretary, may exchange information,
    through the Secretary of State, with foreign governments and
    suggest to the Secretary of State international collaboration and
    conferences on all matters dealing with the safety of life and
    property at sea, other than radio communication.

      Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for
    the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in
    the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard
    and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is
    desirable.
      The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes
    it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or
    participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of
    international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast
    Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the
    Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals,
    safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly
    desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast
    Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed
    international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast
    Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving
    equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio
    communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules
    of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic
    aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of
    personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels. Provisions
    for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and
    the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as
    amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 425(c),

      Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 28,
    42, 57 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch.
    742, Sec. 11, 44 Stat. 817.) Subsection is enlarged to make
    reimbursement for the building of ships or the training of
    personnel dependent on agreement of the Secretaries, and to include
    all schools operated by the Navy, rather than aviation schools
    only.
      Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 31
    (Mar. 6, 1920, ch. 94, Sec. 1, 41 Stat. 506).
      Subsection (c) is new. This subsection enacts what has been the
    practice of the Navy and Coast Guard in keeping the Coast Guard
    trained to "come on board with some muscle" in time of emergency.
      Section 3 of this title deals with the relationship of the Coast
    Guard to the Navy Department. This section deals with cooperation
    with the Navy. Whereas the status of the Coast Guard in time of war
    was treated in chapter 1 of this title, this section has
    application in time of peace when the Coast Guard is not under the
    Navy Department.

      This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the
    Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would not permit any
    cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.
      Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the
    Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in
    the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life
    saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make,
    receive and transmit weather observations and measurements.
    Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting,
    particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing
    importance, and this extensive weather station manning in
    cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the
    postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation
    with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the
    cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for
    years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

      Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 441a (May 19, 1926,
    ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109, 49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1,

      Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the
    Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed
    forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with
    foreign governments.
      It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign
    governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's
    activities in relation to such collaboration will result in
    requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance
    which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This
    section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail
    Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign
    governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56
    Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 441-a), which
    authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps
    officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of
    war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the
    interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

    detailed, offices and such compensation and emoluments thereunder
    appertaining as may be first approved by the Secretary. While so
    detailed such members shall receive, in addition to the
    compensation and emoluments allowed them by such governments, the
    pay and allowances to which they are entitled in the Coast Guard
    and shall be allowed the same credit for longevity, retirement, and
    for all other purposes that they would receive if they were serving
    with the Coast Guard."

      Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making
    provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic
    missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged
    in maritime commerce with the United States. This is largely the
    result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.
      This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the
    State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached
    to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard
    advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic
    missions, in those locations where such advice and information are
    frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization
    of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard
    officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers
    to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of
    March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946
    ed., Sec. 6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign
    Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the

      This section does not change the present method of administration
    of the Academy. It makes statutory what has been administrative
    regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make
    the control of an institution of such national interest as the
    Academy the subject of a statute.
      This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which
    establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is
    there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of
    the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore
    this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal
    with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and
    assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined
    functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as
    previously established, provides for the appointment of the
    Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his
    functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory
    basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory
    position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no
    way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

    CHAPTER 9 - COAST GUARD ACADEMY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 182. Cadets; number, appointment, obligation to serve

-STATUTE-
      (a) The number of cadets appointed annually to the Academy shall
    be as determined by the Secretary but the number appointed in any
    one year shall not exceed six hundred. Appointments to cadetships
    shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who
    shall determine age limits, methods of selection of applicants,
    term of service as a cadet before graduation, and all other matters
    affecting such appointments. In the administration of this chapter,
    the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary and
    appropriate to insure that female individuals shall be eligible for
    appointment and admission to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the
    relevant standards required for appointment, admission, training,
    graduation, and commissioning of female individuals shall be the
    same as those required for male individuals, except for those
    minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of
    physiological differences between male and female individuals. The
    Secretary may summarily dismiss from the Coast Guard any cadet who,
    during his cadetship, is found unsatisfactory in either studies or
    conduct, or may be deemed not adapted for a career in the Coast
    Guard. Cadets shall be subject to rules governing discipline
    prescribed by the Commandant.
      (b) Each cadet shall sign an agreement with respect to the
    cadet's length of service in the Coast Guard. The agreement shall
    provide that the cadet agrees to the following:
        (1) That the cadet will complete the course of instruction at
      the Coast Guard Academy.
        (2) That upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy the cadet
      - 
          (A) will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a
        commissioned officer of the Coast Guard; and
          (B) will serve on active duty for at least five years
        immediately after such appointment.

        (3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not
      tendered or if the cadet is permitted to resign as a regular
      officer before the completion of the commissioned service
      obligation of the cadet, the cadet - 
          (A) will accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in
        the Coast Guard Reserve; and
          (B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of
        the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.

      (c)(1) The Secretary may transfer to the Coast Guard Reserve, and
    may order to active duty for such period of time as the Secretary
    prescribes (but not to exceed four years), a cadet who breaches an
    agreement under subsection (b). The period of time for which a
    cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be
    determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10.
      (2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under
    paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade
    or rating, as determined by the Secretary.
      (3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a cadet shall be
    considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (b) if
    the cadet is separated from the Coast Guard Academy under
    circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by
    the cadet of the cadet's agreement to complete the course of
    instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as
    a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard
    Academy.
      (d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this
    section. Those regulations shall include - 
        (1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose
      of subsection (c), a breach of an agreement under subsection (b);
        (2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has
      occurred; and
        (3) standards for determining the period of time for which a
      person may be ordered to serve on active duty under subsection
      (c).

      (e) In this section, "commissioned service obligation", with
    respect to an officer who is a graduate of the Academy, means the
    period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a
    commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such
    appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date
    up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.
      (f)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a
    citizen or national of the United States.
      (2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or
    a guardian, the cadet may sign the agreement required by subsection
    (b) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.
      (g) A cadet or former cadet who does not fulfill the terms of the
    obligation to serve as specified under section (b), or the
    alternative obligation imposed under subsection (c), shall be
    subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of title 37.

      The last sentence of this section is new, being included in order
    to allow for adjusting the working time and leave of civilian
    instructors in conformity with the academic terms at the Academy.
    The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in
    administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave
    provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an
    instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the
    past. This new provision would permit leave during the summer and
    between academic terms without deduction from pay, and, it is
    contemplated, at no other time.

    Stat. 265).
      Section 15b of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. Part
    of the provisions of the first sentence is placed in this section,
    while other provisions are placed in section 188 of this title.
      Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The
    last sentence is incorporated in this section, while the other
    provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.
      The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed
    materially on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the
    Advisory Committee. The scope of duty of members of the staff is
    enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.
      Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 15b provides for five professors
    as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy. The
    Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after
    extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this
    section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent
    teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the
    designations and grades of faculty members at other universities.
    The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the
    library as the center of the modern university; this is in
    conformity with the practice of other higher educational
    institutions. It is believed that the increased number of permanent
    commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the
    expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a
    four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in the next few
    years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average
    number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up
    for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable
    exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional
    sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally. It is
    pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not
    increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as
    they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of
    this title. If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided
    for permanently it will require the assignment of an additional
    regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in
    this section do not increase the size of the Service, or the
    expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a
    leading educational institution within the present, recognized,
    standards for a proper university faculty. The last sentence
    retains the command status of the professors as provided in
    existing law but enlarges the field in which they may perform duty,
    in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other
    than at the Academy, thus broadening their knowledge of the Service
    while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress,
    House Report No. 557.

      The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because
    of physical disability with less than 15 years' service is changed
    to have application only during the temporary appointment of a
    professor.
      This section provides for the retirement of associate professors,
    assistant professors, and commissioned instructors in addition to
    professors. It is believed that the provision of existing law
    requiring 15 years' service before becoming eligible for
    retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no
    other group was discriminated against, and should be eliminated. It
    was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for
    retirement during their probationary term only.
      Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      This chapter, dealing with the appointment, enlistment,
    promotion, retirement and recall of all military personnel, covers
    subject matter which has been greatly affected by war-time
    legislation and, therefore, has required rather extensive rewriting
    of existing law in order to correlate all of the various
    provisions. An attempt has been made to provide for enlisted men
    and warrant officers in a manner similar to the way that
    commissioned officers are provided for; for example, the act of
    February 21, 1946, ch. 34, 60 Stat. 29 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 162a), made provision for the retirement of commissioned
    officers on half pay after twenty years naval service, and a prewar
    statute provided for twenty year retirement of enlisted men on half
    pay. This leaves warrant officers the only military group not
    eligible for retirement in twenty years, and a provision such as
    found in section 305 of this title, granting such retirement, seems
    clearly indicated in order to avoid unjust discrimination.
      The subject matter seemed to break down into the sub-heads of
    "Commissioned Officers", "Warrant Officers", "Enlisted Men", and
    "General Provisions". Each of the first three sub-heads parallels
    the other two, insofar as the applicability of statutes of the
    three groups permits. The last sub-head includes the broad
    provisions which, in the same terms, can be made applicable to all
    military personnel. In accord with existing Navy and Coast Guard
    law, the term "commissioned officer" includes commissioned warrant
    officers unless specifically excepted, or manifestly inapplicable.
    Heretofore Coast Guard statutes have designated commissioned
    warrant officers as chief warrant officers; in line with Navy
    designation it is changed to commissioned warrant officers
    throughout this title. Terms such as "Coast Guard personnel" or
    "personnel of the Coast Guard", as used throughout this title, are
    intended to include all employees of the Service, civilian and
    military. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The President may appoint permanent commissioned officers
    in the Regular Coast Guard in grades appropriate to their
    qualification, experience, and length of service, as the needs of
    the Coast Guard may require, from among the following categories:
        (A) Graduates of the Coast Guard Academy.
        (B) Commissioned warrant officers, warrant officers, and
      enlisted members of the Regular Coast Guard.
        (C) Members of the Coast Guard Reserve who have served at least
      2 years as such.
        (D) Licensed officers of the United States merchant marine who
      have served 2 or more years aboard a vessel of the United States
      in the capacity of a licensed officer.

      (2) Original appointments under this section in the grades of
    lieutenant commander and above shall be made by the President by
    and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
      (3) Original appointments under this section in the grades of
    ensign through lieutenant shall be made by the President alone.
      (b) No person shall be appointed a commissioned officer under

    fitness to perform the duties of a commissioned officer has been
    established under such regulations as the Secretary shall
    prescribe.
      (c) Appointees under this section shall take precedence in the
    grade to which appointed in accordance with the dates of their

    effect the day before the effective date of this Act [Sept. 24,
    1963] but not promoted to the grade for which they were recommended
    shall be placed on a list of selectees in order of their

    for promotion in the approved report of a selection board convened
    under this Act [enacting sections 41a, 211 to 214, 251 to 262, 271

    the approved report of a selection board convened under this Act.
      "(c) The enactment of this Act does not terminate the appointment
    of any officer.
      "(d) An officer of the Regular Coast Guard who on the day before
    the effective date of this Act had been promoted to and was serving
    on active duty in a temporary grade higher than his permanent grade
    shall be considered to have been promoted to that grade under
    section 271 of title 14, United States Code.
      "(e) An officer of the Regular Coast Guard who was appointed as a
    temporary commissioned officer under any provision of law in effect

    section 214 of title 14, United States Code, and subject to the

    which this Act becomes effective. If, under section 288 of title
    14, United States Code, the retirement of any other officer would
    be required after June 30, 1962, but less than six months following
    the effective date of this Act, his retirement shall be deferred
    until the last day of the twelfth month following the month in
    which this Act becomes effective, or June 30, 1964, whichever is
    earlier.
      "(g) The enactment of this Act does not increase or decrease the
    retired pay of any person retired on or prior to the effective date
    of this Act.
      "(h) Notwithstanding section 1431 of title 10, United States
    Code, an original election, change, or revocation of an election,
    made under that section by an officer who is retired under the
    provisions of section 282, 283, 284, 285, or 288 of title 14,

-STATUTE-
      (a) The president may appoint temporary commissioned officers - 
        (1) in the Regular Coast Guard in a grade, not above
      lieutenant, appropriate to their qualifications, experience, and
      length of service, as the needs of the Coast Guard may require,
      from among the commissioned warrant officers, warrant officers,
      and enlisted members of the Coast Guard, and from holders of
      licenses issued under chapter 71 of title 46; and
        (2) in the Coast Guard Reserve in a grade, not above
      lieutenant, appropriate to their qualifications, experience, and
      length of service, as the needs of the Coast Guard may require,
      from among the commissioned warrant officers of the Coast Guard
      Reserve.

      (b) Temporary appointments under this section do not change the
    permanent, probationary, or acting status of persons so appointed,
    prejudice them in regard to promotion or appointment, or abridge
    their rights or benefits. A person who is appointed under this
    section may not suffer any reduction in the rate of pay and
    allowances to which he would have been entitled had he remained in
    his former grade and continued to receive the increases in pay and
    allowances authorized for that grade.
      (c) An appointment under this section, or a subsequent promotion
    appointment of a temporary officer, may be vacated by the

-STATUTE-
      (a) Before convening a selection board to recommend officers for
    promotion to any grade above lieutenant (junior grade) and below
    rear admiral (lower half), the Secretary shall establish a
    promotion zone for the grade to be considered. The promotion zone
    for each grade shall consist of the most senior officers of that
    grade on the active duty promotion list who are eligible for
    consideration for promotion to the next higher grade and who have
    not previously been placed in a promotion zone for selection for
    promotion to the next higher grade. The number of officers in each
    zone shall be determined after considering - 
        (1) the needs of the service;
        (2) the estimated numbers of vacancies available in future
      years to provide comparable opportunity for promotion of officers
      in successive year groups; and
        (3) the extent to which current terms of service in that grade
      conform to a desirable career promotion pattern.

    However, such number of officers shall not exceed the number to be
    selected for promotion divided by six-tenths.
      (b) Promotion zones from which officers will be selected for
    promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be
    established by the Secretary as the needs of the service require.

    Sec. 257. Eligibility of officers for consideration for promotion

-STATUTE-
      (a) An officer on the active duty promotion list becomes eligible
    for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade at the
    beginning of the promotion year in which he completes the following
    amount of service computed from his date of rank in the grade in
    which he is serving:
        (1) two years in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade);
        (2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;
        (3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;
        (4) four years in the grade of commander; and
        (5) three years in the grade of captain.

      (b) For the purpose of this section, service in a grade includes
    all qualifying service in that grade or a higher grade, under
    either a temporary or permanent appointment. However, service in a
    grade under a temporary service appointment under section 275 of
    this title is considered as service only in the grade that the
    officer concerned would have held had he not been so appointed.
      (c) No officer may become eligible for consideration for
    promotion until all officers of his grade senior to him are so
    eligible.
      (d) Except when his name is on a list of selectees, each officer
    who becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next
    higher grade remains eligible so long as he - 
        (1) continues on active duty; and
        (2) is not promoted to that grade.

      (e) An officer whose involuntary retirement or separation is
    deferred under section 295 of this title is not eligible for
    consideration for promotion to the next higher grade during the
    period of that deferment.
      (f) The Secretary may waive subsection (a) to the extent
    necessary to allow officers described therein to have at least two
    opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher
    grade as officers below the promotion zone.

-STATUTE-
      (a) A selection board convened to recommend officers for
    promotion shall recommend those eligible officers whom the board,
    giving due consideration to the needs of the Coast Guard for
    officers with particular skills so noted in specific direction
    furnished to the board by the Secretary under section 258 of this
    title, considers best qualified of the officers under consideration
    for promotion. No officer may be recommended for promotion unless
    he receives the recommendation of at least a majority of the
    members of a board composed of five members, or at least two-thirds
    of the members of a board composed of more than five members.
      (b) The number of officers that a board convened under section
    251 of this title may recommend for promotion to a grade below rear
    admiral (lower half) from among eligible officers junior in rank to
    the junior officer in the appropriate promotion zone may not exceed
    - 
        (1) 5 percent of the total number of officers that the board is
      authorized to recommend for promotion to the grade of lieutenant
      or lieutenant commander;
        (2) 7 1/2  percent of the total number of officers that the
      board is authorized to recommend for promotion to the grade of
      commander; and
        (3) 10 percent of the total number of officers that the board
      is authorized to recommend for promotion to the grade of captain;

    unless such percentage is a number less than one, in which case the
    board may recommend one such officer for promotion.
      (c)(1) In selecting the officers to be recommended for promotion,
    a selection board may recommend officers of particular merit, from
    among those officers chosen for promotion, to be placed at the top
    of the list of selectees promulgated by the Secretary under section
    271(a) of this title. The number of officers that a board may
    recommend to be placed at the top of the list of selectees may not
    exceed the percentages set forth in subsection (b) unless such a
    percentage is a number less than one, in which case the board may
    recommend one officer for such placement. No officer may be
    recommended to be placed at the top of the list of selectees unless
    he or she receives the recommendation of at least a majority of the
    members of a board composed of five members, or at least two-thirds
    of the members of a board composed of more than five members.
      (2) The Secretary shall conduct a survey of the Coast Guard
    officer corps to determine if implementation of this subsection
    will improve Coast Guard officer retention. A selection board may
    not make any recommendation under this subsection before the date
    on which the Secretary publishes a finding, based upon the results
    of the survey, that implementation of this subsection will improve
    Coast Guard officer retention.
      (3) The Secretary shall submit any finding made by the Secretary
    pursuant to paragraph (2) to the Committee on Transportation and
    Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on
    Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 263. Special selection boards; correction of errors

-STATUTE-
      (a) Officers Not Considered Due to Administrative Error. - 
        (1) In general. - If the Secretary determines that as the
      result of an administrative error - 
          (A) an officer or former officer was not considered for
        selection for promotion by a selection board convened under
        section 251; or
          (B) the name of an officer or former officer was not placed
        on an all-fully-qualified-officers list;

      the Secretary shall convene a special selection board to
      determine whether such officer or former officer should be
      recommended for promotion and such officer or former officer
      shall not be considered to have failed of selection for promotion
      prior to the consideration of the special selection board.
        (2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion. - If a
      special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not
      recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade
      is below the grade of captain and whose name was referred to that
      board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be
      considered to have failed of selection for promotion.

      (b) Officers Considered But Not Selected; Material Error. - 
        (1) In general. - In the case of an officer or former officer
      who was eligible for promotion, was considered for selection for
      promotion by a selection board convened under section 251, and
      was not selected for promotion by that board, the Secretary may
      convene a special selection board to determine whether the
      officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion, if
      the Secretary determines that - 
          (A) an action of the selection board that considered the
        officer or former officer - 
            (i) was contrary to law in a matter material to the
          decision of the board; or
            (ii) involved material error of fact or material
          administrative error; or

          (B) the selection board that considered the officer or former
        officer did not have before it for consideration material
        information.

        (2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion. - If a
      special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not
      recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade
      is that of commander or below and whose name was referred to that
      board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be
      considered - 
          (A) to have failed of selection for promotion with respect to
        the board that considered the officer or former officer prior
        to the consideration of the special selection board; and
          (B) to incur no additional failure of selection for promotion
        as a result of the action of the special selection board.

      (c) Requirements for Special Selection Boards. - Each special
    selection board convened under this section shall - 
        (1) be composed in accordance with section 252 and the members
      of the board shall be required to swear the oaths described in
      section 254;
        (2) consider the record of an applicable officer or former
      officer as that record, if corrected, would have appeared to the
      selection board that should have considered or did consider the
      officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the
      special selection board and that record shall be compared with a
      sampling of the records of - 
          (A) those officers of the same grade who were recommended for
        promotion by such prior selection board; and
          (B) those officers of the same grade who were not recommended
        for promotion by such prior selection board; and

        (3) submit to the Secretary a written report in a manner
      consistent with sections 260 and 261.

      (d) Appointment of Officers Recommended for Promotion. - 
        (1) In general. - An officer or former officer whose name is
      placed on a promotion list as a result of the recommendation of a
      special selection board convened under this section shall be
      appointed, as soon as practicable, to the next higher grade in
      accordance with the law and policies that would have been
      applicable to the officer or former officer had the officer or
      former officer been recommended for promotion by the selection
      board that should have considered or did consider the officer or
      former officer prior to the consideration of the special
      selection board.
        (2) Effect. - An officer or former officer who is promoted to
      the next higher grade as a result of the recommendation of a
      special selection board convened under this section shall have,
      upon such promotion, the same date of rank, the same effective
      date for the pay and allowances of that grade, and the same
      position on the active duty promotion list as the officer or
      former officer would have had if the officer or former officer
      had been recommended for promotion to that grade by the selection
      board that should have considered or did consider the officer or
      former officer prior to the consideration of the special
      selection board.
        (3) Record correction. - If the report of a special selection
      board convened under this section, as approved by the President,
      recommends for promotion to the next higher grade an officer not
      eligible for promotion or a former officer whose name was
      referred to the board for consideration, the Secretary may act
      under section 1552 of title 10 to correct the military record of
      the officer or former officer to correct an error or remove an
      injustice resulting from the officer or former officer not being
      selected for promotion by the selection board that should have
      considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to
      the consideration of the special selection board.

      (e) Application Process and Time Limits. - The Secretary shall
    issue regulations regarding the process by which an officer or
    former officer may apply to have a matter considered by a special
    selection board convened under this section, including time limits
    related to such applications.
      (f) Limitation of Other Jurisdiction. - No official or court of
    the United States shall have authority or jurisdiction over any
    claim based in any way on the failure of an officer or former
    officer to be selected for promotion by a selection board convened
    under section 251, until - 
        (1) the claim has been referred to a special selection board
      convened under this section and acted upon by that board; or
        (2) the claim has been rejected by the Secretary without
      consideration by a special selection board convened under this
      section.

      (g) Judicial Review. - 
        (1) In general. - A court of the United States may review - 
          (A) a decision of the Secretary not to convene a special
        selection board under this section to determine if the court
        finds that the decision of the Secretary was arbitrary or
        capricious, not based on substantial evidence, or otherwise
        contrary to law; and
          (B) an action of a special selection board under this section
        to determine if the court finds that the action of the special
        selection board was contrary to law or involved material error
        of fact or material administrative error.

        (2) Remand and reconsideration. - If, with respect to a review
      under paragraph (1), a court makes a finding described in
      subparagraph (A) or (B) of that paragraph, the court shall remand
      the case to the Secretary and the Secretary shall provide the
      applicable officer or former officer consideration by a new
      special selection board convened under this section.

      (h) Designation of Boards. - The Secretary may designate a
    selection board convened under section 251 as a special selection
    board convened under this section. A selection board so designated
    may function in the capacity of a selection board convened under
    section 251 and a special selection board convened under this
    section.

-STATUTE-
      (a) When the report of a board convened to recommend officers for
    promotion has been approved by the President, the Secretary shall
    place the names of all officers selected and approved on a list of
    selectees in the order of their seniority on the active duty
    promotion list. The names of all officers approved by the President
    and recommended by the board to be placed at the top of the list of
    selectees shall be placed at the top of the list of selectees in
    the order of seniority on the active duty promotion list.
      (b) Officers on the list of selectees may be promoted by
    appointment in the next higher grade to fill vacancies in the
    authorized active duty strength of the grade as determined under
    section 42 of this title after officers on any previous list of
    selectees for that grade have been promoted. Officers shall be
    promoted in the order that their names appear on the list of
    selectees. The date of rank of an officer promoted under this
    subsection shall be the date of his appointment in that grade.
      (c) An officer serving on active duty in the grade of ensign may,
    if found fully qualified for promotion in accordance with
    regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be promoted to the grade
    of lieutenant (junior grade) by appointment after he has completed
    twelve months' active service in grade. The date of rank of an
    officer promoted under this subsection shall be the date of his
    appointment in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) as specified
    by the Secretary.
      (d) When a vacancy in the grade of rear admiral occurs, the
    senior rear admiral (lower half) serving on the active duty
    promotion list shall be appointed by the President, by and with the
    advice and consent of the Senate, to fill the vacancy. The
    appointment shall be effective on the date the vacancy occurred.

    grade) or lieutenant. Appointments of Reserve officers shall be
    made as prescribed in section 12203 of title 10.
      (f) The promotion of an officer who is under investigation or
    against whom proceedings of a court-martial or a board of officers
    are pending may be delayed without prejudice by the Secretary until
    completion of the investigation or proceedings. However, unless the
    Secretary determines that a further delay is necessary in the
    public interest, a promotion may not be delayed under this
    subsection for more than one year after the date the officer would
    otherwise have been promoted. An officer whose promotion is delayed
    under this subsection and who is subsequently promoted shall be
    given the date of rank and position on the active duty promotion
    list in the grade to which promoted that he would have held had his
    promotion not been so delayed.

    with subsection (a), and the needs of the service require, the
    President may, under regulations prescribed by him, promote to a
    higher grade any officer serving on active duty in the grade of
    ensign or above in the Coast Guard.
      (c) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by the
    President or Congress, the President may, under regulations to be

      (e) A promotion under this section to a grade above lieutenant
    may be made only upon the recommendation of a board of officers
    convened for that purpose.

    appointment for temporary service. Original appointments under this
    section in the grades of lieutenant commander and above shall be
    made by the President by and with the advice and consent of the
    Senate. Original appointments under this section in the grades of
    ensign through lieutenant shall be made by the President alone. Any

    under this section is effective for such period as the President
    determines. However, an appointment may not be effective later than
    six months after the end of the war or national emergency. When his
    temporary appointment under this section is terminated or expires,
    the officer shall revert to his former grade.
      (i) Not later than six months after the end of the war or
    national emergency the President shall, under such regulations as
    he may prescribe, reestablish the active duty promotion list with
    adjustments and additions appropriate to the conditions of original
    appointment and wartime service of all officers to be included
    thereon. The President may, by and with the advice and consent of
    the Senate, appoint officers on the reestablished active duty
    promotion list to fill vacancies in the authorized active duty
    strength of each grade. Such appointments shall be considered to
    have been made under section 271 of this title.

      (a) The Secretary may, whenever the needs of the service require,
    but not more often than annually, convene a board consisting of not
    less than six officers of the grade of rear admiral (lower half) or
    rear admiral to recommend for continuation on active duty officers
    on the active duty promotion list serving in the grade of captain,
    who during the promotion year in which the board meets will
    complete at least three years' service in that grade and who have
    not been selected for promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower
    half). Officers who are subject to retirement under section 288 of
    this title during the promotion year in which the board meets shall
    not be considered by this board.
      (b) Whenever he convenes a board under this section, the
    Secretary shall establish a continuation zone. The zone shall
    consist of the most senior captains eligible for consideration for
    continuation on active duty who have not previously been placed in
    a continuation zone under this section. The Secretary shall, based
    upon the needs of the service, prescribe the number of captains to
    be included in the zone.
      (c) Based on the needs of the service the Secretary shall furnish
    the board with the number of officers that may be recommended for
    continuation on active duty. This number shall be no less than 50
    percent of the number considered. The board shall select from the
    designated continuation zone, in the number directed by the
    Secretary, those officers who are, in the opinion of the board,
    best qualified for continuation on active duty.
      (d) The provisions of sections 253, 254, 258, and 260 of this
    title relating to selection for promotion shall, to the extent that
    they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section,
    apply to boards convened under this section.
      (e) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the detailed
    procedures whereby officers in a continuation zone will be selected
    for continuation on active duty.
      (f) A board convened under this section shall submit its report
    to the Secretary. If the board has acted contrary to law or
    regulation, the Secretary may return the report for proceedings in
    revision and resubmission to the Secretary. After his final review
    the Secretary shall submit the report of the board to the President
    for his approval. Except as required by the procedures of this
    section, the proceedings of the board shall not be disclosed to any
    person not a member of the board.
      (g) Each officer who is considered but not recommended for
    continuation on active duty under the provisions of this section
    shall, unless retired under some other provision of law, be retired
    on June 30 of the promotion year in which the report of the
    continuation board convened under this section is approved, or the
    last day of the month in which he completes twenty years of active
    service, whichever is later.
      (h) Notwithstanding subsection (g) and section 288 of this title,
    the Commandant may by annual action retain on active duty from
    promotion year to promotion year any officer who would otherwise be
    retired under subsection (g) or section 288 of this title. An
    officer so retained, unless retired under some other provision of
    law, shall be retired on June 30 of that promotion year in which no
    action is taken to further retain the officer under this
    subsection.

    officers being considered for continuation.
      (c) The provisions of sections 253, 254, 258, and 260 of this
    title relating to selection and continuation boards shall to the
    extent they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
    section, apply to boards convened under this section.
      (d) A board convened under this section shall submit its report

    admiral or vice admiral or the position of Superintendent of the
    Coast Guard Academy, or retired under another provision of law, an
    officer so retained shall be retired on July 1 of the promotion
    year immediately following the promotion year in which no action is
    taken to further retain that officer under this paragraph.
      (g)(1) Unless retired under another provision of law, an officer
    subject to this section shall, except as provided in paragraph (2),
    be retired on July 1 of the promotion year immediately following
    the promotion year in which that officer completes a total of
    thirty-six years of active commissioned service unless selected for
    or serving in the grade of admiral.

      Section 35 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The
    provisions of the first sentence of subsection (a) are placed in
    this section. The proviso of subsection (a) is covered in section
    367(b) of this title. Subsection (b) is placed in section 365 of
    this title. Subsections (c) and (d) are placed in section 367(a) of
    this title, except that part (3) of subsection (c) is covered by
    section 366 of this title.
      Section 206 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. That
    part dealing with special temporary enlistments is incorporated in
    this section. That part dealing with temporary appointments of
    warrant officers is placed in section 302 of this title.
      Certain additional details concerning the two types of
    enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in
    Coast Guard Regulations.
      This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in
    the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority
    to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of
    enlistment from "not to exceed four years" to "not to exceed six
    years", and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their
    minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law
    applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and
    define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the
    Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types.
    The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original
    enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is

    However, the total of all such extensions of an enlistment may not
    exceed six years. No such extension shall operate to deprive the
    enlisted member concerned, upon discharge at the termination
    thereof, of any right, privilege, or benefit to which he would have
    been entitled if his term of enlistment had not been so extended.

-STATUTE-
      Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an enlisted member
    may be detained in the Coast Guard beyond the term of his
    enlistment:
        (1) until the first arrival of the vessel on which he is
      serving at its permanent station, or at a port in a State of the
      United States or in the District of Columbia; or
        (2) if attached to a shore station beyond the continental
      limits of the United States or in Alaska, until his first arrival
      at a port in any State of the United States or in the District of
      Columbia where his reenlistment or discharge may be effected, or
      until he can be discharged or reenlisted at his station beyond
      the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska,
      whichever is earlier, but in no event to exceed three months; or
        (3) during a period of war or national emergency as proclaimed
      by the President, and, in the interest of national defense, for a
      period not to exceed six months after the end of the war or the
      termination of the emergency; or
        (4) for a period of not exceeding thirty days in other cases
      whether or not specifically covered by this section, when
      essential to the public interests, and the determination that
      such detention is essential to the public interests, made in
      accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be
      final and conclusive.

    Any member detained in the Coast Guard as provided in this section
    shall be entitled to receive pay and allowances and benefits under
    the same conditions as though his enlistment period had not
    expired, and shall be subject in all respects to the laws and
    regulations for the government of the Coast Guard until his
    discharge therefrom. Enlisted members detained under the provisions
    of clause (1) shall be entitled to the pay and allowances provided
    for enlisted personnel of the Navy detained under similar
    circumstances.

      Subsection (a) is new in this form, but the provision contained
    therein is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to
    the retirement of military personnel.
      A provision defining the next higher grade to that of
    commissioned warrant officer as lieutenant (junior grade), for
    purposes of retirement, was added.
      The other provisions of said section are obsolete and are no

      Subsection (a) is new, but the provision contained in it is

    covered, either by other sections dealing with retirement or by

    Sec. 423. Computation of retired pay

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a
    uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10) before
    September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying - 
        (A) the sum of - 
          (i) the basic pay of the member's retired grade or rate, and
          (ii) all permanent additions thereto including longevity
        credit to which the member was entitled at the time of
        retirement; by

        (B) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of
      title 10 for the number of years of service that may be credited
      to the member under section 1405 of such title.

      (2) In the case of an officer who served as Commandant of the
    Coast Guard, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed at
    the highest rate of basic pay applicable to the officer while so
    serving.
      (3) In the case of an enlisted member who served as the master
    chief petty officer of the Coast Guard, retired pay under paragraph
    (1) shall be computed at the highest rate of basic pay to which the
    member was entitled while so serving, if that basic pay is greater
    than the basic pay of the grade or rate to which the member is
    otherwise entitled at the time of retirement.
      (4) In the case of an officer whose retired pay is computed on
    the pay of a grade for which basic pay is not based upon years of
    service, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed on the
    basis of the number of years of service for which the officer would
    be entitled to credit in the computation of pay on the active list
    had the officer been serving in the grade of captain at the time of
    retirement.
      (b) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a
    uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10) on or
    after September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying - 
        (1) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title
      10; by
        (2) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of
      title 10 for the number of years of service that may be credited
      to the member under section 1405 of such title.

      (c)(1) In computing for the purpose of subsection (a) or (b) the
    number of years of service that may be credited to a member under
    section 1405 of title 10 - 
        (A) each full month of service that is in addition to the
      number of full years of service creditable to the member shall be
      counted as  1/12  of a year; and
        (B) any remaining fractional part of a month shall be
      disregarded.

      (2) Retired pay computed under this section, if not a multiple of
    $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.

      1986 - Pub. L. 99-348 amended section generally. Prior to

    would be computed at the rate of 2 1/2  percent of the sum of the
    basic pay of that grade or rating and all permanent additions
    thereto including longevity credit, multiplied by the number of
    years of service credited, with certain exceptions, and that
    retired pay of an officer or member of the Coast Guard who first
    became a member of a uniformed service, as defined in section
    1407(a)(2) of title 10, after Sept. 7, 1980, would be computed at
    the rate of 2 1/2  percent of the monthly retired pay base computed
    under section 1407(f) of title 10, multiplied by the number of
    years of service credited, but that retired pay was not to be more
    than 75 percent of such monthly retired pay base.

    computing the number of years of service by which the rate of 2 1/2
     percent is multiplied, each full month of service that is in
    addition to the number of full years of service creditable to a
    member is counted as one-twelfth of a year and any remaining
    fractional part of a month is disregarded" for "A fractional year
    of six months or more shall be considered a full year in computing
    the number of years of service by which the rate of 2 1/2  percent
    is multiplied".
      Pub. L. 98-94, Sec. 922(b), inserted "Retired pay, if not a
    multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1."
      1982 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97-295 substituted "after September
    7, 1980" for "on or after the date of the enactment of the

      1980 - Pub. L. 96-342 designated existing provisions as subsec.
    (a), substituted "Except as provided in subsection (b), the" for
    "The", and added subsec. (b).

    an enlisted member serving as the master chief petty officer of the
    Coast Guard at the highest basic pay applicable to him while he so
    served, if that basic pay is greater than the basic pay of the
    grade or rating to which he was otherwise entitled at the time of
    retirement.
      1963 - Pub. L. 88-132 substituted "basic" for "active-duty"
    wherever appearing.
      1958 - Pub. L. 85-422 substituted "that may be credited to him
    under section 1405 of title 10" for "for which he was entitled to
    credit in the computation of his pay when last on active duty".
      1950 - Act Aug. 3, 1950, struck out reference to computation of
    pay of retired personnel retired by reason of physical disability.

    Secretary of the Treasury or who, being qualified, do not accept a
    commission thereunder, shall operate to increase by one the total
    authorized number of line officers of the Coast Guard.
      (c) All persons of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned,
    appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall be subject to all
    laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard, and
    nothing contained in this title shall be construed to prevent the
    application to any of such persons of laws and regulations
    concerning the military discipline of commissioned and warrant
    officers and enlisted members of the Coast Guard.
      (d) In computing length of service, for the purpose of retirement
    in the Coast Guard, of any person of the former Lighthouse Service
    commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard, there
    shall be included all service computable for retirement under the
    provisions of section 763 of title 33; and after July 1, 1948, in
    computing longevity for the purpose of pay of such person there
    shall be included all service of such person in the Lighthouse
    Service.
      (e) No person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the
    Coast Guard shall suffer any reduction in the total of the annual
    compensation and allowances which he was receiving on the date of
    his commission, appointment, or enlistment. Upon his retirement
    from active duty in the Coast Guard, the retired pay of any person
    so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted, shall not be less than an
    annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of section 763
    of title 33, substituting, however, for purposes of such
    computation, the annual compensation which he was receiving on the
    date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment in the Coast
    Guard for the average annual pay received by him for the last five
    years of service.
      (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapter 51,
    subchapter III of chapter 53, and sections 5542-5546 of title 5
    shall not apply to civilian keepers of lighthouses and to civilians
    employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard.
      (g)(1) The head of the department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating under regulations prescribed by him, may regulate the
    hours of duty and the pay of civilian keepers of lighthouses and
    civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast
    Guard, but such personnel may be called upon for duty in emergency
    circumstances or otherwise at any time or all times. The existing
    system governing the pay of such employees may be continued or
    changed except that overtime compensation, night differential, and
    extra pay for duty on holidays shall not be paid to such employees.
    In lieu thereof additional annual compensation may be authorized,
    which may be prescribed either as a fixed differential or as a
    percentage of the basic compensation otherwise applicable to such
    employees. In no case shall basic compensation exceed $15,000 per
    annum, except that nothing contained in this subsection shall
    operate to decrease the basic compensation of any person employed
    by the Coast Guard on the date of enactment of this subsection, and
    in no case shall additions thereto exceed 25 percent of such basic
    compensation. Provision may be made for compensatory absence from
    duty when conditions of employment result in confinement because of
    isolation or in long periods of continuous duty; and provisions may
    likewise be made for extra allowance for service outside of the
    continental limits of the United States.
      (2) The additional compensation authorized by this subsection
    shall be included in any computation of compensation under section
    6 of the Act of June 20, 1918 (33 U.S.C. 763).

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Chapter 13 of this title deals with pay, allowances, awards, and
    other rights and benefits for personnel of the Coast Guard. Some of
    these sections are new as applied to the Coast Guard, some clarify
    and consolidate existing law, and others merely restate existing
    law. There is no intention to amend, enlarge or curtail the Pay
    Readjustment Act of 1942, as amended. 81st Congress, House Report
    No. 557.

-MISC1-
                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 20a, 121 (May 18,
    1920, ch. 190, Sec. 8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch. 212, 42
    Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, Sec. 10, 44 Stat. 817).
      Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of
    the U.S. Code, but it has been held that the assimilation provision
    thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific
    legislative provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits
    derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously
    conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent
    legislation, survive to the Coast Guard under the assimilation
    statute. (See 27 Comp. Dec. 234; 22 Comp. Gen. 723; decision of
    June 9, 1947, B-63472; decision of April 2, 1948, B-70438; and
    decision of September 2, 1948, B-77295.)
      It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to
    pay in order to cover any failure to provide specifically for the
    Coast Guard in military pay legislation.
      This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the
    Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of the Navy. It seems
    that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of
    military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of
    military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is
    intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as
    provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty:
    for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel
    assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation
    duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted
    persons assigned to duty in the mess detail. Military pay acts are
    intended to include Coast Guard personnel specifically; this
    section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard
    personnel in a pay act.
      Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No.
    557.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1976 - Pub. L. 94-546 substituted "Secretary" for "Secretary of
    the Treasury".
      1967 - Pub. L. 90-83 corrected section 73(a)(3) of Pub. L. 89-718
    to change the designation of sections repealed under Pub. L. 87-649
    from sections 471(a) and (b) of Title 14 to sections 461(a) and (b)
    of Title 14. See 1966 Amendment note below.
      1966 - Pub. L. 89-718, Sec. 73(a)(3), amended section 14d of Pub.
    L. 87-649, which contained in cls. (1) to (6) list of sections of
    Title 14 repealed by Pub. L. 87-649, by inserting "(7) Section
    471(a) and (b)." However, for purposes of codification, the repeal
    has been executed to former subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section,
    which provided respectively for the awarding of the same pay and
    allowances as prescribed for corresponding ranks, grades, or
    ratings for personnel of the Navy and for the withholding of pay of
    officers on account of indebtedness to the United States, since
    this appears to have been the intent of Congress.
      Pub. L. 89-718, Sec. 73(c)(1), struck out references to pay and
    allowances and pay of officers indebted to the United States from
    section catchline and struck out letter designation "(c)" from
    beginning of former subsec. (c), leaving text of former subsec. (c)
    as constituting entire text of section.
      1962 - Pub. L. 87-526, Sec. 1(1)(A), amended section catchline to
    provide for remission of indebtedness of enlisted members.
      Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 87-526, Sec. 1(1)(B), added subsec. (c).
      1954 - Act Sept. 3, 1954 inserted "; pay of officers indebted to
    United States" in section catchline, designated existing provisions
    as subsec. (a), and added subsec. (b).

                     EFFECTIVE DATE OF 1967 AMENDMENT                 
      Pub. L. 90-83, Sec. 9(i), Sept. 11, 1967, 81 Stat. 222, provided
    that: "Section 2 of this Act [correcting section 73(a)(3) of Pub.

    Sec. 475. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate
      housing

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or
    near Coast Guard installations, wherever located, for assignment as
    public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if any,
    without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his
    designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or
    near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also
    authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public
    quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on
    sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do
    not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any
    fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided
    in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing
    facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a
    multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in
    accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be
    made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on
    an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental
    of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized
    for the Department of Defense in any year except where the
    Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of
    necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is
    authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that
    rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for
    the Department of Defense.
      (b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved
    by the President - 
        (1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may
      determine to be inadequate as public quarters; and
        (2) to lease inadequate housing to members of the Coast Guard
      for occupancy by them and their dependents.

      (c) Where sufficient quarters are not possessed by the United
    States, the Commandant may hire quarters for personnel, including
    personnel on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of
    their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions
    which may render them uninhabitable. Such accommodations shall not
    be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.

    occupy on a rental basis, without loss of basic allowance for
    quarters, inadequate quarters under the jurisdiction of the Coast
    Guard notwithstanding that such quarters may have been constructed
    or converted for assignment as public quarters. The net difference
    between the basic allowance for quarters and the fair rental value
    of such quarters shall be paid from otherwise available
    appropriations; however, no rental charge for such quarters shall
    be made against the basic allowance for quarters of a member of the
    Coast Guard in excess of 75 percent of such allowance except that
    in no event shall the net rental value charged to the member's
    basic allowance for quarters be less than the cost of maintaining
    and operating the housing."

      The limitation on the amount for such contingencies is increased,
    and the amount is made available to the Commandant rather than
    solely to the Superintendent of the Academy as now prescribed by
    law. The authorization is to cover expenditures incident to the
    offices of the Commandant and the Superintendent of the Academy.

    manner similar to that now employed by the Superintendent of the
    Academy under the authority of 14 U.S.C., Sec. 15k. 81st Congress,

    239). Said section 13 was changed to have application to all
    enlisted personnel rather than to "crews of vessels in service"
    only. The provision of said section 754 which provided for the sale
    of clothing to civilian employees is eliminated as becoming
    obsolete.
      Subsection (c) is new. Title 37, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 110
    authorizes the payment of a cash allowance in case clothing is not
    furnished to enlisted persons of the Coast Guard. Clearly this
    presumes the authority to issue clothing to enlisted persons; this
    section makes the authority statutory. 81st Congress, House Report
    No. 557.

    involving actual conflict with an enemy, or in the line of his
    profession, and without detriment to the mission of his command or
    to the command to which attached, to permit its award for
    distinguished service by members of the Coast Guard while engaged
    in an action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award
    a Life-saving medal of gold or silver to any person, including
    personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue
    any other person from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the
    water in accordance with the following provisions:
        (1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of
      one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal
      shall be of gold;
        (2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently
      distinguished to deserve the medal of gold, but evidences the
      exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the
      medal shall be of silver.

      (b) In order for a person to be eligible for the Life-saving
    Medals the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters
    within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or
    if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters,
    one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United
    States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens
    of the United States.
      (c) No person shall receive more than one gold medal and one
    silver medal; but any person who has received or may hereafter
    receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act which
    would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be
    awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or
    silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already
    bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may
    be awarded. Medals and bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this
    subsection, may be awarded posthumously.

      Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs. 193, 194, 195, 196
    (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, Sec. 7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch.
    265, Sec. 12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, Sec. 9, 22 Stat.
    57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).
      Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of
    Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an
    interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional
    grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in
    any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the
    United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United
    States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue
    took place within waters of the United States the award could be
    made to an alien.
      The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving
    Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., Secs. 192-196, has
    long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of
    statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result
    has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted
    in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 193), provided for Life-
    saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed "upon
    any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving,
    or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the
    United States, or upon any American vessel". The medal of the first
    class was confined to cases of "extreme and heroic daring" and the
    medal of the second class was to be awarded "in cases not
    sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class"
    Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class
    "upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and
    succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning" as, in
    the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition.
    These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be
    limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils
    of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of
    any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And
    the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to
    members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon,
    in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts
    should "be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury
    to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in
    rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from
    drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction,
    whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not
    members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions
    were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station". (Title 14,
    U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 196.) This act was designed to give a more
    liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to
    be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult
    questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different
    jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14,
    U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 193, refers to rescues "within the United
    States", while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Sec. 196, refers to
    rescues "in the waters over which the United States has
    jurisdiction". The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection
    (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including
    Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any
    person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the
    rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and
    evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold,
    and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently
    distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion
    of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be
    of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded
    are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional
    limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to
    define the required deed together with those limitations.
    Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of
    act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and
    clarifies existing law.
      Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the
    awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the
    provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to
    authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United
    States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts,
    such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a
    United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or
    United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly,
    rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be
    recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the
    United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue
    takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its
    jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either
    the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or
    aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus,
    every case in which the United States government has an interest is
    provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act
    sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign
    waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive
    such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals
    should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn
    rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and
    heroic acts.
      Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional
    acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 195, except that authority is granted to award medals
    posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

    with the oversight of Coast Guard major acquisition programs. The
    memorandum of understanding or memorandum of agreement shall, at a
    minimum, provide for -

      improve its acquisition management, either through internal
      reforms or by seeking acquisition expertise from the Department
      of Defense; and
        (3) addresses specifically the question of whether the Coast
      Guard can better leverage Department of Defense or other
      agencies' contracts that would meet the needs of Level 1 or Level
      2 acquisitions in order to obtain the best possible price.

      when all capability and asset acquisitions are to be completed
      and when all acquired capabilities and assets are to be initially
      and fully deployed.

      (c) Analysis of Alternatives. - 
        (1) In general. - The Coast Guard may not acquire an
      experimental or technically immature capability or asset or
      implement a Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program,
      unless it has prepared an analysis of alternatives for the
      capability or asset to be acquired in the concept and technology
      development phase of the acquisition process for the capability
      or asset.
        (2) Requirements. - The analysis of alternatives shall be
      prepared by a federally funded research and development center, a
      qualified entity of the Department of Defense, or a similar
      independent third-party entity that has appropriate acquisition
      expertise and has no financial interest in any part of the
      acquisition project or program that is the subject of the
      analysis. At a minimum, the analysis of alternatives shall
      include - 
          (A) an assessment of the technical maturity of the capability
        or asset, and technical and other risks;
          (B) an examination of capability, interoperability, and other
        advantages and disadvantages;
          (C) an evaluation of whether different combinations or
        quantities of specific assets or capabilities could meet the
        Coast Guard's overall performance needs;
          (D) a discussion of key assumptions and variables, and
        sensitivity to change in such assumptions and variables;
          (E) when an alternative is an existing capability, asset, or
        prototype, an evaluation of relevant safety and performance
        records and costs;
          (F) a calculation of life-cycle costs including - 
            (i) an examination of likely research and development costs
          and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated
          costs;

          costs and the levels of uncertainty associated with such
          estimated costs;
            (iii) an examination of likely operating and support costs
          and the levels of uncertainty associated with such estimated
          costs;
            (iv) if they are likely to be significant, an examination
          of likely disposal costs and the levels of uncertainty
          associated with such estimated costs; and
            (v) such additional measures as the Commandant or the
          Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
          operating determines to be necessary for appropriate
          evaluation of the capability or asset; and

          (G) the business case for each viable alternative.

      (d) Test and Evaluation Master Plan. - 
        (1) In general. - For any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition

      test and evaluation master plan specific to the acquisition
      project or program for the capability, asset, or subsystems of
      the capability or asset and intended to minimize technical, cost,
      and schedule risk as early as practicable in the development of
      the project or program.
        (2) Test and evaluation strategy. - The master plan shall - 
          (A) set forth an integrated test and evaluation strategy that
        will verify that capability-level or asset-level and subsystem-
        level design and development, including performance and
        supportability, have been sufficiently proven before the
        capability, asset, or subsystem of the capability or asset is
        approved for production; and
          (B) require that adequate developmental tests and evaluations
        and operational tests and evaluations established under
        subparagraph (A) are performed to inform production decisions.

        (3) Other components of the master plan. - At a minimum, the
      master plan shall identify - 
          (A) the key performance parameters to be resolved through the
        integrated test and evaluation strategy;
          (B) critical operational issues to be assessed in addition to
        the key performance parameters;
          (C) specific development test and evaluation phases and the
        scope of each phase;
          (D) modeling and simulation activities to be performed, if
        any, and the scope of such activities;
          (E) early operational assessments to be performed, if any,
        and the scope of such assessments;
          (F) operational test and evaluation phases;
          (G) an estimate of the resources, including funds, that will
        be required for all test, evaluation, assessment, modeling, and
        simulation activities; and
          (H) the Government entity or independent entity that will
        perform the test, evaluation, assessment, modeling, and
        simulation activities.

        (4) Update. - The Chief Acquisition Officer must approve an
      updated master plan whenever there is a revision to project or
      program test and evaluation strategy, scope, or phasing.
        (5) Limitation. - The Coast Guard may not - 
          (A) proceed beyond that phase of the acquisition process that
        entails approving the supporting acquisition of a capability or
        asset before the master plan is approved by the Chief
        Acquisition Officer; or
          (B) award any production contract for a capability, asset, or
        subsystem for which a master plan is required under this
        subsection before the master plan is approved by the Chief
        Acquisition Officer.

      (e) Life-Cycle Cost Estimates. - 
        (1) In general. - The Commandant shall implement mechanisms to
      ensure the development and regular updating of life-cycle cost
      estimates for each acquisition with a total acquisition cost that
      equals or exceeds $10,000,000 and an expected service life of 10
      or more years, and to ensure that these estimates are considered
      in decisions to develop or produce new or enhanced capabilities
      and assets.
        (2) Types of estimates. - In addition to life-cycle cost
      estimates that may be developed by acquisition program offices,
      the Commandant shall require that an independent life-cycle cost
      estimate be developed for each Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition
      project or program.
        (3) Required updates. - For each Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition
      project or program the Commandant shall require that life-cycle
      cost estimates shall be updated before each milestone decision is
      concluded and the project or program enters a new acquisition
      phase.

      572(d)(1).
        (2) Use of third parties. - The Commandant shall ensure that
      the Coast Guard uses independent third parties with expertise in
      testing and evaluating the capabilities or assets and the
      subsystems of the capabilities or assets being acquired to
      conduct developmental tests and evaluations and operational tests
      and evaluations whenever the Coast Guard lacks the capability to
      conduct the tests and evaluations required by a master plan.
        (3) Communication of safety concerns. - The Commandant shall
      require that safety concerns identified during developmental or
      operational tests and evaluations or through independent or
      Government-conducted design assessments of capabilities or assets
      and subsystems of capabilities or assets to be acquired by the
      Coast Guard shall be communicated as soon as practicable, but not
      later than 30 days after the completion of the test or assessment
      event or activity that identified the safety concern, to the
      program manager for the capability or asset and the subsystems
      concerned and to the Chief Acquisition Officer.
        (4) Reporting of safety concerns. - Any safety concerns that
      have been reported to the Chief Acquisition Officer for an

    baseline for any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition program, by - 
        (1) a likely cost overrun greater than 15 percent of the
      acquisition program baseline for that individual capability or
      asset or a class of capabilities or assets;
        (2) a likely delay of more than 180 days in the delivery
      schedule for any individual capability or asset or class of
      capabilities or assets; or
        (3) an anticipated failure for any individual capability or
      asset or class of capabilities or assets to satisfy any key
      performance threshold or parameter under the acquisition program
      baseline.

      (b) Content. - The report submitted under subsection (a) shall
    include - 
        (1) a detailed description of the breach and an explanation of
      its cause;

    U.S.C., 1946 ed. Secs. 22, 58, 91, 99, 103 (R.S. 2749; June 18,

      Said section 91 has been divided. That part dealing with
    investigation of plans and inventions is covered in section 93(d)
    of this title. The remainder is covered in general terms. It has
    been rewritten in broad terms, making clear that the Commandant is
    granted the necessary authority to administer the Coast Guard under
    the Secretary, including authority to issue rules, orders, and
    instructions.
      This section is primarily a consolidation of existing functions
    rather than a codification of existing laws. It does not, for the
    most part, grant new authority to the Coast Guard as an
    organization. It merely clarifies the method by which Coast Guard
    functions shall be administered. Under existing statutes, functions
    relating to the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President,
    the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant, and sometimes
    upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the
    Secretary of the Navy in times of war. This revision confers some
    functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides
    for the execution of those functions by the Commandant, the
    military head of the organization, thereby making for consistency
    and uniformity. The functions are to be executed "subject to the
    general supervision of the Secretary". Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed.,
    Sec. 91 now grants authority to the Commandant to prescribe
    regulations; this is changed to the issuance of rules, orders, and
    instructions as the promulgation of regulations in a military
    organization is properly a function of the Secretary.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) Whenever any vessel liable to seizure or examination does
    not stop on being ordered to do so or on being pursued by an
    authorized vessel or authorized aircraft which has displayed the
    ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia prescribed for an
    authorized vessel or authorized aircraft, the person in command or
    in charge of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft may,
    subject to paragraph (2), fire at or into the vessel which does not
    stop.
      (2) Before firing at or into a vessel as authorized in paragraph
    (1), the person in command or in charge of the authorized vessel or
    authorized aircraft shall fire a gun as a warning signal, except
    that the prior firing of a gun as a warning signal is not required
    if that person determines that the firing of a warning signal would
    unreasonably endanger persons or property in the vicinity of the
    vessel to be stopped.
      (b) The person in command of an authorized vessel or authorized
    aircraft and all persons acting under that person's direction shall
    be indemnified from any penalties or actions for damages for firing
    at or into a vessel pursuant to subsection (a). If any person is
    killed or wounded by the firing, and the person in command of the
    authorized vessel or authorized aircraft or any person acting
    pursuant to their orders is prosecuted or arrested therefor, they
    shall be forthwith admitted to bail.
      (c) A vessel or aircraft is an authorized vessel or authorized
    aircraft for purposes of this section if - 
        (1) it is a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft;
        (2) it is a surface naval vessel or military aircraft on which
      one or more members of the Coast Guard are assigned pursuant to
      section 379 of title 10; or
        (3) any (!1) other vessel or aircraft on government
      noncommercial service when -

      This section closely parallels title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., Secs.
    797, 798, which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate
    amicable settlement of claims against the United States arising out
    of the operation of Naval vessels. It grants similar authority to
    the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast
    Guard service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000
    to $25,000. It is believed that this section will work to the
    benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the
    number of claims which must presently be certified to Congress for
    appropriations in order to make settlement. It will greatly
    expedite the settlement of just claims and should result in a
    considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress,

      The Secretary may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine,
    compromise, or settle claims for damage cognizable in admiralty in
    a district court of the United States and all claims for damage
    caused by a vessel or floating object, to property of the United
    States under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard or property for
    which the Coast Guard may have assumed, by contract or otherwise,
    any obligation to respond for damage thereto. The Secretary is
    further authorized to receive in payment of any such claim the
    amount due the United States pursuant to determination, compromise,
    or settlement as herein authorized and, upon acceptance of such
    payment but not until then, such determination, settlement, or
    compromise of such claim shall be final and conclusive for all
    purposes, any law to the contrary notwithstanding. All such
    payments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as
    miscellaneous receipts. The Secretary is further authorized to
    execute on behalf of the United States and to deliver in exchange
    for such payment a full release of such claim. This section, as
    respects the determination, compromise, settlement, and payment of
    claims, shall be supplementary to, and not in lieu of, all other
    provisions of law authorizing the determination, compromise, or
    settlement of claims for damage to property hereinabove described.
    No settlement or compromise where there is involved a payment in
    the net amount of over $100,000 is authorized by this section.

    600a, 600b, which authorize the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate
    amicable settlements of affirmative claims of the United States for
    damage to Government property. Experience gained by the Navy since

    complement those of section 646 of this title and the two sections

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary may prescribe regulations governing accounting for
    industrial work, including charges for overhead for civilian labor
    and for maintenance of industrial plant and equipment, performed at
    the Coast Guard Yard or such similar Coast Guard industrial
    establishments as he may designate. Any orders placed for such
    industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or advance of funds
    to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such
    accounts as may be necessary and established by the Secretary to
    carry out the provisions of this section. Accounts so established
    shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and
    civilian labor, including overhead and maintenance, required in
    performing the work ordered. Upon completion of an order an
    adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced
    equal to the actual cost as computed in accordance with the
    accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

    inefficient method of accounting for industrial jobs at the Coast
    Guard Yard and other shore establishments where industrial work may
    be undertaken. Under existing law several accounts must be kept
    current for each job in progress. Under this statute the working
    fund would be available for all types of expenditures in connection
    with a job and the breakdown into separate accounts could be done
    after the job is complete. The other armed forces have provisions
    of law which permit a working fund similar to the one provided by

-STATUTE-
      (a) A Coast Guard Supply Fund is authorized. The Secretary may
    prescribe regulations for designating the classification of
    materials to be stocked. In these regulations, whenever the fund is
    extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts
    obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of
    major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts
    were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in
    the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable
    materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried
    in other accounts. Except for the materials so transferred, the
    fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or
    otherwise acquired. The fund shall be credited with the value of
    materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of,
    such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately
    cover the cost thereof.
      (b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations,
    be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard
    Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary,
    with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels
    consistently with planned operations for the next year.

    duration of a war or national emergency any restriction contained
    in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in
    the same manner to remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast
    Guard. Included are restrictions relating to the manner in which
    purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and
    personnel. This provision is designed to enable the Coast Guard to
    operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or
    during a national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more
    effectively to maintain itself in a state of military readiness
    during periods of emergency. Since the Coast Guard operates as part
    of the Navy in time of war, it is essential that its operations be
    as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it
    is to be a part. This section would prevent inadvertent failures
    specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the type

    costs shall be paid to the Secretary by the film producers who
    request such assistance, on terms determined by the Secretary. The
    Secretary may waive costs not exceeding $200 for one production,
    and may waive other costs related to noncommercial productions

      total costs under the contract; and
        (B) there are realistic estimates of both the cost of the
      contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a
      multiyear contract.

      (3) A multiyear contract authorized under subsection (a) of this
    section shall contain cancellation and termination provisions to
    the extent necessary to protect the best interests of the United
    States, and may include consideration of both recurring and
    nonrecurring costs. The contract may provide for a cancellation
    payment to be made. Amounts that were originally obligated for the
    cost of the contract may be used for cancellation or termination
    costs.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary is authorized, subject to the availability of
    appropriations, to enter into lease agreements to acquire real
    property or interests therein for a term not to exceed 20 years,
    inclusive of any automatic renewal clauses, for special purpose
    facilities, including, aids to navigation (hereafter in this
    section referred to as "ATON") sites, vessel traffic service
    (hereafter in this section referred to as "VTS") sensor sites, or
    National Distress System (hereafter in this section referred to as
    "NDS") high level antenna sites. These lease agreements shall
    include cancellation and termination provisions to the extent
    necessary to protect the best interests of the United States.
    Cancellation payment provisions may include consideration of both
    recurring and nonrecurring costs associated with the real property
    interests under the contract. These lease agreements may provide
    for a cancellation payment to be made. Amounts that were originally
    obligated for the cost of the contract may be used for cancellation
    or termination costs.
      (b) For purposes of this section, the term "special purpose
    facilities" means any facilities used to carry out Coast Guard
    aviation, maritime, or navigation missions other than general
    purpose office and storage space facilities.
      (c) In the case of ATON, VTS, or NDS sites, the Secretary may
    enter into multiyear lease agreements under subsection (a) of this
    section whenever the Secretary finds that - 
        (1) the use of such a lease agreement will promote the
      efficiency of the ATON, VTS, or NDS programs and will result in
      reduced total costs under the agreement;
        (2) the minimum need for the real property or interest therein
      to be leased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during
      the contemplated lease period; and
        (3) the estimates of both the cost of the lease and the
      anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear lease
      are realistic.

        (A) to make payments as the agent of the disbursing official;
        (B) to sign checks drawn on disbursing accounts of the
      Secretary of the Treasury; and
        (C) to carry out other duties required under law.

      (2) The penalties for misconduct that apply to a disbursing
    official apply to a deputy disbursing official designated under

      (3) A disbursing official may make a designation under paragraph
    (1) only with the approval of the Secretary.
      (b)(1) If a disbursing official of the Coast Guard dies, becomes

    service in the Navy unless and until the designation is terminated
    by the disbursing official who made the designation or an official
    authorized to approve such a designation under subsection (a)(3) of

    training, or engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, is
    entitled to the same benefits as a member of the Navy Reserve of
    corresponding grade, rating, and length of service. In determining
    length of service for the purpose of this section, there shall be
    included all service for which credit is given by law to members of
    the Regular Coast Guard.
      (b) Chapter 13 of this title applies to a member of the Reserve
    under the same conditions and limitations as it applies to a member
    of the Regular Coast Guard.

    by law for a member of the Navy Reserve who suffers sickness,
    disease, disability, or death under similar conditions.
      (d) A member of the Reserve on active duty or when retired for
    disability is entitled to the benefits of section 253(a) of title
    42. A member of the Reserve when on active duty (other than for
    training) or when retired for disability is entitled to the

    on the basis of years of active service, is entitled to the same
    retirement rights, benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law
    for a member of the Navy Reserve, and wherever a law confers
    authority upon the Secretary of the Navy, similar authority is
    given to the Secretary to be exercised with respect to the Coast
    Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the
    Navy. An enlisted member of the Reserve who retires on the basis of
    years of active service is entitled to the same retirement rights,
    benefits, and privileges as prescribed by law for an enlisted
    member of the Regular Coast Guard.
      (f) A member of the Coast Guard Reserve not on active duty who is
    enrolled in an officer candidate program authorized by section
    12209 of title 10 leading to a commission in the Coast Guard

-HEAD-
    Sec. 707. Temporary members of the Reserve; disability or death
      benefits

-STATUTE-
      (a) If a temporary member of the Reserve is physically injured,
    or dies as a result of physical injury, and the injury is incurred
    incident to service while performing active duty, or engaged in
    authorized travel to or from that duty, the law authorizing
    compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries
    while in the performance of their duties, applies, subject to this
    section. That law shall be administered by the Secretary of Labor
    to the same extent as if the member was a civil employee of the
    United States and was injured in the performance of that duty. For
    benefit computation, regardless of pay or pay status, the member is
    considered to have had monthly pay of the monthly equivalent of the
    minimum rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS-9 of the General
    Schedule on the date the injury is incurred.
      (b) This section does not apply if the workmen's compensation law
    of a State, a territory, or another jurisdiction provides coverage
    because of a concurrent employment status of the temporary member.
    When the temporary member or a dependent is entitled to a benefit
    under this section and also to a concurrent benefit from the United
    States on account of the same disability or death, the temporary
    member or dependent, as appropriate, shall elect which benefit to
    receive.
      (c) If a claim is filed under this section with the Secretary of
    Labor for benefits because of an alleged injury or death, the
    Secretary of Labor shall notify the Commandant who shall direct an
    investigation into the facts surrounding the alleged injury or
    death. The Commandant shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor
    whether or not the injured or deceased person was a temporary
    member of the Reserve, the person's military status, and whether or
    not the injury or death was incurred incident to military service.
      (d) A temporary member of the Reserve, who incurs a physical
    disability or contracts sickness or disease while performing a duty
    to which the member has been assigned by competent authority, is
    entitled to the same hospital treatment afforded a member of the
    Regular Coast Guard.
      (e) In administering section 8133 of title 5, for a person
    covered by this section - 
        (1) the percentages applicable to payments under that section
      are - 
          (A) 45 percent under subsection (a)(2) of that section, where
        the member died fully or currently insured under title II of
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), with no
        additional payments for a child or children so long as the
        widow or widower remains eligible for payments under that
        subsection;
          (B) 20 percent under subsection (a)(3) of that section, for
        one child, and 10 percent additional for each additional child,
        not to exceed a total of 75 percent, where the member died
        fully or currently insured under title II of the Social
        Security Act; and
          (C) 25 percent under subsection (a)(4) of that section, if
        one parent was wholly dependent for support upon the deceased
        member at the time of the member's death and the other was not
        dependent to any extent; 16 percent to each if both were wholly
        dependent; and if one was, or both were, partly dependent, a
        proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of
        Labor;

        (2) payments may not be made under subsection (a)(5) of that
      section; and
        (3) the Secretary of Labor shall inform the Commissioner of
      Social Security whenever a claim is filed and eligibility for
      compensation is established under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of
      section 8133 of title 5. The Commissioner of Social Security
      shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the
      member concerned was fully or currently insured under title II of
      the Social Security Act at the time of the member's death.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 709a. Reserve student pre-commissioning assistance program

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to an eligible
    enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve, not on active duty, for
    expenses of the member while the member is pursuing on a full-time
    basis at an institution of higher education a program of education
    approved by the Secretary that leads to - 
        (1) a baccalaureate degree in not more than 5 academic years;
      or
        (2) a post-baccalaureate degree.

      (b)(1) To be eligible for financial assistance under this
    section, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve shall - 
        (A) be enrolled on a full-time basis in a program of education
      referred to in subsection (a) at any institution of higher
      education; and
        (B) enter into a written agreement with the Coast Guard
      described in paragraph (2).

      (2) A written agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is an
    agreement between the member and the Secretary in which the member
    agrees - 
        (A) to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the
      Coast Guard Reserve, if tendered;
        (B) to serve on active duty for up to five years; and
        (C) under such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed by
      the Secretary, to serve in the Coast Guard Reserve until the
      eighth anniversary of the date of the appointment.

      (c) Expenses for which financial assistance may be provided under
    this section are the following:
        (1) Tuition and fees charged by the institution of higher
      education involved.
        (2) The cost of books.
        (3) In the case of a program of education leading to a
      baccalaureate degree, laboratory expenses.
        (4) Such other expenses as are deemed appropriate by the
      Secretary.

      (d) The amount of financial assistance provided to a member under
    this section shall be prescribed by the Secretary, but may not
    exceed $25,000 for any academic year.
      (e) Financial assistance may be provided to a member under this
    section for up to 5 consecutive academic years.
      (f) A member who receives financial assistance under this section
    may be ordered to active duty in the Coast Guard Reserve by the
    Secretary to serve in a designated enlisted grade for such period
    as the Secretary prescribes, but not more than 4 years, if the
    member - 
        (1) completes the academic requirements of the program and
      refuses to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the
      Coast Guard Reserve when offered;
        (2) fails to complete the academic requirements of the
      institution of higher education involved; or
        (3) fails to maintain eligibility for an original appointment
      as a commissioned officer.

      (g)(1) If a member requests to be released from the program and
    the request is accepted by the Secretary, or if the member fails
    because of misconduct to complete the period of active duty
    specified, or if the member fails to fulfill any term or condition
    of the written agreement required to be eligible for financial
    assistance under this section, the financial assistance shall be
    terminated. The Secretary may request the member to reimburse the
    United States in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total
    costs of the education provided to that member as the unserved
    portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty the
    member agreed to serve. The Secretary shall have the option to
    order such reimbursement without first ordering the member to
    active duty. An obligation to reimburse the United States imposed
    under this paragraph is a debt owed to the United States.
      (2) The Secretary may waive the service obligated under
    subsection (f) of a member who becomes unqualified to serve on
    active duty due to a circumstance not within the control of that
    member or who is not physically qualified for appointment and who
    is determined to be unqualified for service as an enlisted member
    of the Coast Guard Reserve due to a physical or medical condition
    that was not the result of the member's own misconduct or grossly
    negligent conduct.
      (3) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is entered less
    than 5 years after the termination of a written agreement entered
    into under subsection (b) does not discharge the individual signing
    the agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under
    paragraph (1).
      (h) As used in this section, the term "institution of higher
    education" has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the
    Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).

    Sec. 712. Active duty for emergency augmentation of regular forces

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding another law, and for the emergency
    augmentation of the Regular Coast Guard forces during a, or to aid
    in prevention of an imminent, serious natural or manmade disaster,
    accident, catastrophe, act of terrorism (as defined in section
    2(16) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101(16))), or
    transportation security incident as defined in section 70101 of

    organized training unit of the Coast Guard Ready Reserve, a member
    thereof, or a member not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a

      (b) Under the circumstances of the domestic emergency involved, a
    reasonable time shall be allowed between the date when a Reserve
    member ordered to active duty under this section is alerted for
    that duty and the date when the member is required to enter upon
    that duty. Unless the Secretary determines that the nature of the
    domestic emergency does not allow it, this period shall be at least
    two days.
      (c) Active duty served under this section - 
        (1) satisfies on a day-for-day basis all or a part of the

      in authorized travel to or from that duty, to all rights and
      benefits, including pay and allowances and time creditable for
      pay and retirement purposes, to which the member would be
      entitled while performing other active duty.

      (d) Reserve members ordered to active duty under this section
    shall not be counted in computing authorized strength of members on
    active duty or members in grade under this title or under any other
    law.
      (e) For purposes of calculating the duration of active duty
    allowed pursuant to subsection (a), each period of active duty
    shall begin on the first day that a member reports to active duty,
    including for purposes of training.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 724. Authorized number of officers

-STATUTE-
      (a) The authorized number of officers in the Reserve in an active
    status is 5,000. Reserve officers on an active-duty list shall not
    be counted as part of the authorized number of officers in the
    Reserve. The actual number of Reserve officers in an active status
    at any time shall not exceed the authorized number unless the
    Secretary determines that a greater number is necessary for planned
    mobilization requirements, or unless the excess results directly
    from the operation of law.
      (b)(1) The Secretary shall make, at least once each year, a
    computation to determine the number of Reserve officers in an
    active status authorized to be serving in each grade. The number in
    each grade shall be computed by applying the applicable percentage
    to the total number of such officers serving in an active status on
    the date the computation is made. The number of Reserve officers in
    an active status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall
    be distributed by pay grade so as not to exceed percentages of
    commissioned officers authorized by section 42(b) of this title.
    When the actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a
    particular pay grade is less than the maximum percentage
    authorized, the difference may be applied to the number in the next
    lower grade. A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade
    solely because of a reduction in an authorized number as provided
    for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from
    the operation of law.
      (2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status
    not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and
    rear admiral is a total of two. However, the Secretary of the
    department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize an
    additional number of Reserve officers not on active duty in the
    grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral as necessary
    in order to meet planned mobilization requirements.
      (c) Deferral of Limitation. - If at the end of any fiscal year
    there is in effect a declaration of war or national emergency, the
    President may defer the effectiveness of any end-strength
    limitation with respect to that fiscal year prescribed by law for
    any military or civilian component of the Coast Guard Reserve, for
    a period not to exceed 6 months after the end of the war or
    termination of the national emergency.

    lieutenant commander, 22.0; lieutenant, 37.0; and the combined
    grades of lieutenant (junior grade) and ensign, 32.5. When the
    actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a grade is
    less than the number authorized, the difference may be applied to
    increase the authorized number in a lower grade. A Reserve officer
    may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction
    in an authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or
    because an excess results directly from the operation of law."

      (a) Reserve officers rank and take precedence in their respective
    grades among themselves and with officers of the same grade on the
    active duty promotion list and the permanent commissioned teaching
    staff in accordance with their dates of rank. When Reserve officers
    and officers on the active duty promotion list or the permanent

    they take precedence as determined by the Secretary.
      (b) Notwithstanding any other law, a Reserve officer shall not
    lose precedence when transferred to or from the active duty
    promotion list, nor shall that officer's date of rank be changed
    due to the transfer.
      (c) A Reserve officer shall, when on the active duty promotion
    list, be promoted in the same manner as any other officer on the
    active duty promotion list regardless of the length of active duty
    service of the Reserve officer.
      (d) Notwithstanding any other law, a Reserve officer shall not
    lose precedence by reason of promotion to the grade of rear admiral
    or rear admiral (lower half), if the promotion is determined in
    accordance with a running mate system.
      (e) The Secretary shall adjust the date of rank of a Reserve
    officer so that no changes of precedence occur.

    Sec. 726. Running mates

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall assign a running mate to each Reserve
    officer in an active status not on the active duty promotion list.
    The officer initially assigned as a running mate under this section
    shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list of the same
    grade who is next senior in precedence to the Reserve officer
    concerned. An officer who has twice failed of selection or who has
    been considered but has not been recommended for continuation under
    section 289 of this title shall not be assigned as a running mate
    under this section.
      (b) A Reserve officer in an active status not on the active duty
    promotion list shall be assigned a new running mate as follows:
        (1) If a previously assigned running mate is promoted from
      below the promotion zone, is removed from the active duty
      promotion list, suffers a loss of numbers, fails of selection,
      fails to qualify for promotion, or declines an appointment after
      being selected for promotion, the new running mate shall be that
      officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who
      is next senior to the previous running mate and who is, or may
      become, eligible for consideration for promotion. If the previous
      running mate was on a list of selectees for promotion, the new
      running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion
      list, of the same grade, who is on a list of selectees for
      promotion and who is next senior to the previous running mate.
        (2) If a Reserve officer suffers a loss of numbers, the new
      running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion
      list who, after the loss of numbers has been effected, is the
      running mate of the Reserve officer next senior to the Reserve
      officer concerned.
        (3) If a Reserve officer is considered for promotion and fails
      of selection, fails to qualify for promotion, declines an
      appointment after being selected for promotion, or has his or her
      name removed from a list of selectees for promotion, and that
      officer's running mate is promoted, the new running mate shall be
      that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same
      grade, who, at the time the previous running mate was considered
      for promotion, was next senior to the previous running mate, was
      eligible for consideration for promotion, and whose name was not
      included on a list of selectees for promotion.
        (4) In a situation not expressly covered by this subsection,
      the Secretary may assign a new running mate as necessary to
      effect the intent of this section that inequitable changes of
      precedence do not occur.

      (c) A Reserve officer on the active duty promotion list shall, to
    the extent practicable and consistent with the limitations imposed
    by this section, be assigned as the running mate of all Reserve
    officers junior to the officer, who are in an active status not on
    the active duty promotion list, and who had a running mate in
    common with the officer just prior to the time the officer was
    placed on the active duty promotion list.
      (d) The Secretary may adjust, as necessary, the date of rank of a
    Reserve officer not on active duty so that the date will correspond
    with that of the running mate assigned to the officer in accordance
    with this section. If an overpayment of pay or allowances results
    from adjusting the date of rank, the overpayment is not subject to
    recoupment.

    Sec. 729. Promotion; recommendations of selection boards

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, a Reserve officer shall
    only be promoted pursuant to the recommendation of a selection
    board.
      (b) The Secretary shall convene selection boards from time to
    time to recommend Reserve officers for promotion to the next higher
    grade. A board may be convened to consider officers in one or more
    grades.
      (c) A selection board shall, from among the names of those
    eligible Reserve officers submitted to it, recommend for promotion
    to the next higher grade:
        (1) those officers serving in the grade of lieutenant (junior
      grade) or above whom it considers to be best qualified; and
        (2) those officers serving in the grade of ensign whom it
      considers to be fully qualified.

      (d)(1) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve
    officers for promotion, the Secretary shall establish a promotion
    zone for officers serving in each grade to be considered by the
    board. The Secretary shall determine the number of officers in the
    promotion zone for officers serving in any grade from among
    officers who are eligible for promotion in that grade.
      (2)(A) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve
    officers for promotion to a grade (other than the grade of
    lieutenant (junior grade)), the Secretary shall determine the
    maximum number of officers in that grade that the board may
    recommend for promotion.
      (B) The Secretary shall make the determination under subparagraph
    (A) of the maximum number that may be recommended with a view to
    having in an active status a sufficient number of Reserve officers
    in each grade to meet the needs of the Coast Guard for Reserve
    officers in an active status.
      (C) In order to make the determination under subparagraph (B),
    the Secretary shall determine the following:
        (i) The number of positions needed to accomplish mission
      objectives that require officers in the grade to which the board
      will recommend officers for promotion.
        (ii) The estimated number of officers needed to fill vacancies
      in such positions during the period in which it is anticipated
      that officers selected for promotion will be promoted.
        (iii) The number of officers authorized by the Secretary to
      serve in an active status in the grade under consideration.
        (iv) Any statutory limitation on the number of officers in any
      grade authorized to be in an active status.

      (3)(A) The Secretary may, when the needs of the Coast Guard
    require, authorize the consideration of officers in a grade above
    lieutenant (junior grade) for promotion to the next higher grade
    from below the promotion zone.
      (B) When selection from below the promotion zone is authorized,
    the Secretary shall establish the number of officers that may be
    recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone. That
    number may not exceed the number equal to 10 percent of the maximum
    number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for
    promotion, except that the Secretary may authorize a greater
    number, not to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers
    that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion, if the
    Secretary determines that the needs of the Coast Guard so require.
    If the maximum number determined under this subparagraph is less
    than one, the board may recommend one officer for promotion from
    below the promotion zone.
      (C) The number of officers recommended for promotion from below
    the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of officers
    that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion under
    paragraph (2).
      (e) The law and regulations relating to the selection for
    promotion of a commissioned officer of the Regular Coast Guard to
    the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral apply to a
    Reserve officer, except that to be eligible for consideration for
    promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half) an officer
    shall have completed at least ten years commissioned service, of
    which the last five years shall have been served in the Coast Guard
    Reserve.
      (f) The provisions of section 260 of this title apply to boards
    convened under this section. The Secretary shall determine the
    procedure to be used by a selection board.
      (g) The report of a selection board shall be submitted to the
    Secretary for review and transmission to the President for
    approval. When an officer recommended by a board for promotion is
    not acceptable to the President, the President may remove the name
    of that officer from the report of the board.
      (h) The recommendations of a selection board, as approved by the
    President, constitute a list of selectees from which the promotions
    of Reserve officers shall be made. An officer on a list of
    selectees remains thereon until promoted unless removed by the

    tendered appointments prior to those on the later list.
      (i) A Reserve officer whose name is on a list of selectees for
    promotion shall, unless that officer's promotion is lawfully
    withheld, be tendered an appointment in the next higher grade on
    the date a vacancy occurs, or as soon thereafter as practicable in
    the grade to which the officer was selected for promotion or, if
    promotion was determined in accordance with a running mate system,
    at the same time, or as soon thereafter as practicable, as that
    officer's running mate is tendered a similar appointment.

      2000 - Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 106-398 amended subsec. (d)
    generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (d) read as follows: "Before
    convening a selection board to recommend Reserve officers for
    promotion to a grade above lieutenant (junior grade), the Secretary
    shall determine the total number of Reserve officers to be selected
    for promotion to that grade. The number to be selected shall
    normally be equal to the number of vacancies existing in that
    grade, plus the number of vacancies anticipated over the next
    twelve months, minus the number of officers on the list of
    selectees for that grade. The Secretary may, however, prescribe
    regulations that provide for the establishment of promotion
    opportunity percentages for each grade to ensure that equitable
    promotion opportunities exist among successive groups of Reserve
    officers being considered for promotion. The number so determined
    may not cause the number of Reserve officers in an active status in
    a grade to exceed that authorized for the grade concerned."
      1985 - Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 99-145 substituted "rear admiral
    (lower half)" for "commodore" wherever appearing.

-STATUTE-
      (a) A selection board shall (1) be appointed and convened by the
    Secretary; (2) consist of at least 50 per centum Reserve officer
    membership, except in the case of a flag officer selection board
    where, to the extent practicable, it shall consist of at least 50
    per centum Reserve officer membership; (3) consist only of members,
    Reserve or Regular, senior in grade to any officer being considered
    by that board; and (4) be composed of not less than five members,
    which number constitutes a quorum.
      (b) A selection board serves for the length of time prescribed by
    the Secretary, but no board may serve longer than one year. No
    officer may serve on two consecutive selection boards for the same
    grade when the second of those boards considers an officer who was
    considered, but not recommended for promotion, by the first
    selection board.
      (c) Each member of a selection board shall swear that he will,
    without prejudice or partiality, and having in view both the
    special fitness required of officers and the efficiency of the
    Coast Guard, perform the duties imposed upon him. Not less than a
    majority of the total membership of a selection board shall concur
    in each recommendation made by the board.
      (d) An officer eligible for consideration for promotion by a
    selection board may forward, through official channels, a written
    communication inviting the attention of the board to any matter in
    the officer's record in the armed forces that, in the opinion of
    the officer concerned, is important to the board's consideration. A
    communication forwarded under this subsection shall arrive in time
    to allow delivery to the board prior to its convening, and may not
    criticize or reflect upon the character, conduct, or motive of any
    officer.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Authority To Use Running Mate System. - The Secretary may by
    regulation implement section 729(d)(1) of this title by requiring
    that the promotion zone for consideration of Reserve officers in an
    active status for promotion to the next higher grade be determined
    in accordance with a running mate system as provided in subsection
    (b).
      (b) Consideration for Promotion. - If promotion zones are
    determined as authorized under subsection (a), a Reserve officer
    shall, subject to the eligibility requirements of this subchapter,
    be placed in a promotion zone when that officer's running mate is
    placed in a promotion zone and shall, in accordance with the
    provisions of this subchapter, be considered for promotion at
    approximately the same time as that officer's running mate or as
    soon thereafter as practicable, or in the event that promotion is
    not determined in accordance with a running mate system, then a
    Reserve officer becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to
    the next higher grade at the beginning of the promotion year in
    which he or she completes the following amount of service computed
    from the date of rank in the grade in which he or she is serving:
        (1) two years in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade);
        (2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;
        (3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;
        (4) four years in the grade of commander; and
        (5) three years in the grade of captain.

      (c) Consideration of Officers Below the Zone. - If the Secretary
    authorizes the selection of officers for promotion from below the
    promotion zone in accordance with section 729(d)(3) of this title,
    the number of officers to be considered from below the zone may be
    established through the application of the running mate system
    under this subchapter or otherwise as the Secretary determines to
    be appropriate to meet the needs of the Coast Guard.

      (a) When a Reserve officer is promoted to the next higher grade

      (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to
    subsection (c), if promotion of an inactive duty promotion list
    officer to the grade of rear admiral or rear admiral (lower half)
    is determined in accordance with a running mate system, a reserve
    officer, if acceptable to the President and the Senate, shall be

    officer's running mate is promoted.
      (c) For the purposes of this section, the date of appointment
    shall be that date when promotion authority is exercised by the
    Secretary. However, the Secretary may adjust the date of
    appointment - 
        (1) if a delay in the finding required under section 734(a) of

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding any other law, if a Reserve officer is promoted
    when the officer's running mate is promoted and the promotion of
    the running mate is on a temporary basis, the promotion of the
    Reserve officer is also on a temporary basis. If subsequently the
    running mate is reverted to a lower grade, other than for reasons
    of discipline, incompetence, or at the running mate's request, the
    Reserve officer shall likewise revert to the same lower grade with
    corresponding precedence.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The President may, for cause, remove the name of any officer
    from a list of selectees established under section 729 of this
    title.
      (b) If the Senate, where required, does not consent to the
    appointment of an officer whose name is on a list of selectees
    established under section 729 of this title, that officer's name
    shall be removed from the list.
      (c) An officer whose name is removed from a list of selectees
    under subsection (a) or (b) continues to be eligible for
    consideration for promotion. If selected for promotion by the next
    selection board and promoted, that officer shall be assigned the
    date of rank and precedence that would have been assigned if the
    officer's name had not been previously removed. However, if the
    officer is not selected by the next selection board, or if the
    officer's name is again removed from the list of selectees, the
    officer shall be considered for all purposes as having twice failed
    of selection for promotion.

    selection if not selected for promotion by the selection board that
    considered the officer, or if having been selected for promotion by
    the board, the officer's name is thereafter removed from the report
    of the board by the President.
      (b) A Reserve officer is not considered to have failed of
    selection if the officer was not considered by a selection board
    because of administrative error. If that officer is selected by the
    next appropriate selection board after the error is discovered, and
    is promoted, the same date of rank and precedence shall be assigned
    that would have been assigned if the officer had been recommended
    for promotion by the selection board that originally would have
    considered the officer but for the error.

    Sec. 740. Failure of selection and removal from an active status

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary - 
        (1) may remove from an active status a Reserve officer who has
      twice failed of selection to the next higher grade; and
        (2) shall remove from an active status a Reserve officer
      serving in the grade of captain who has completed thirty years of
      total commissioned service and whose name is not carried on an
      approved list of selectees for promotion to the grade of rear
      admiral (lower half).

      (b) A Reserve officer who has twice failed of selection to the
    next higher grade and who is not removed from an active status
    under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be retained for the
    period prescribed by the Secretary.
      (c) Subject to section 12646 of title 10, a Reserve officer who
    is removed from an active status under subsection (a) of this
    section shall be given an opportunity to transfer to the Retired
    Reserve, if qualified, but unless so transferred shall, in the
    discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the inactive status
    list or discharged as follows:
        (1) if removed from an active status under subsection (a)(1) of
      this section, on June 30 next following the approval date of the
      board report by virtue of which the officer's second failure of
      selection occurs; or
        (2) if removed from an active status under subsection (a)(2) of
      this section, on June 30 next following the date on which the
      officer completes thirty years of total commissioned service as
      computed under this section.

      (d) For the purpose of this section, the total commissioned
    service of an officer who has served continuously in the Reserve
    following appointment in the grade of ensign shall be computed from
    the date on which that appointment to the Reserve was accepted. A
    Reserve officer initially appointed in a grade above ensign is
    considered to have the actual total commissioned service performed
    in a grade above commissioned warrant officer or the same total
    commissioned service as an officer of the Regular Coast Guard who
    has served continuously from an original appointment as ensign, who
    has not lost numbers or precedence, and who is, or was, junior to
    the Reserve officer, whichever is greater.

    of Reserve officers in an active status in any grade to provide a
    steady flow of promotion, or that there is an excessive number of
    Reserve officers in an active status in any grade, the Secretary
    may appoint and convene a retention board to consider all of the
    Reserve officers in that grade in an active status who have 18

        (1) are on extended active duty;
        (2) are on a list of selectees for promotion;

      board is convened.

    The retention board shall select and recommend a specified number
    of the officers under consideration for retention in an active

      (b) This board shall - 
        (1) to the extent practicable, consist of at least 50 per
      centum Reserve officers;
        (2) consist only of officers who are senior in rank to any
      officers being considered by that board; and
        (3) to the extent practicable, consist of officers who have not
      served on the last previous retention board which considered
      officers of the same grade.

      (c) Subject to section 12646 of title 10, a Reserve officer who
    is not recommended for retention in an active status under this
    section shall be given an opportunity to transfer to the Retired
    Reserve, if qualified, but unless so transferred shall, in the
    discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the inactive status
    list or discharged on June 30 next following the date on which the
    report of the retention board is approved.

-STATUTE-
      No member of the Auxiliary, solely by reason of such membership,
    shall be vested with, or exercise, any right, privilege, power, or
    duty vested in or imposed upon the personnel of the Coast Guard or
    the Reserve, except that any such member may, under applicable
    regulations, be assigned duties, which, after appropriate training
    and examination, he has been found competent to perform, to
    effectuate the purposes of the Auxiliary. No member of the
    Auxiliary shall be placed in charge of a motorboat, yacht,
    aircraft, or radio station assigned to Coast Guard duty unless he
    has been specifically designated by authority of the Commandant to
    perform such duty. Members of the Auxiliary, when assigned to
    duties as herein authorized shall, unless otherwise limited by the
    Commandant, be vested with the same power and authority, in the
    execution of such duties, as members of the regular Coast Guard
    assigned to similar duty. When any member of the Auxiliary is
    assigned to such duty he may, pursuant to regulations issued by the
    Secretary, be paid actual necessary traveling expenses, including a
    per diem allowance in conformity with standardized Government
    travel regulations in lieu of subsistence, while traveling and
    while on duty away from his home. No per diem shall be paid for any
    period during which quarters and subsistence in kind are furnished
    by the Government, and no per diem shall be paid for any period
    while such member is performing duty on a vessel.
