      to accelerate the construction of Federal-aid highway systems,
      including the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate
      and Defense,(!2) because many of the highways (or portions of the
      highways) are inadequate to meet the needs of local and
      interstate commerce for the national and civil defense.

        (2) Completion of interstate system. - Congress declares that
      the prompt and early completion of the Dwight D. Eisenhower
      National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (referred to
      in this section as the "Interstate System"), so named because of
      its primary importance to the national defense, is essential to
      the national interest. It is the intent of Congress that the
      Interstate System be completed as nearly as practicable over the
      period of availability of the forty years' appropriations
      authorized for the purpose of expediting its construction,
      reconstruction, or improvement, inclusive of necessary tunnels
      and bridges, through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996,
      under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (70
      Stat. 374), and that the entire system in all States be brought
      to simultaneous completion. Insofar as possible in consonance
      with this objective, existing highways located on an interstate
      route shall be used to the extent that such use is practicable,
      suitable, and feasible, it being the intent that local needs, to
      the extent practicable, suitable, and feasible, shall be given
      equal consideration with the needs of interstate commerce.
        (3) Transportation needs of 21st century. - Congress declares
      that - 
          (A) it is in the national interest to preserve and enhance
        the surface transportation system to meet the needs of the
        United States for the 21st Century;
          (B) the current urban and long distance personal travel and
        freight movement demands have surpassed the original forecasts
        and travel demand patterns are expected to continue to change;
          (C) continued planning for and investment in surface
        transportation is critical to ensure the surface transportation
        system adequately meets the changing travel demands of the
        future;
          (D) among the foremost needs that the surface transportation
        system must meet to provide for a strong and vigorous national
        economy are safe, efficient, and reliable - 
            (i) national and interregional personal mobility (including
          personal mobility in rural and urban areas) and reduced
          congestion;
            (ii) flow of interstate and international commerce and
          freight transportation; and
            (iii) travel movements essential for national security;

          (E) special emphasis should be devoted to providing safe and
        efficient access for the type and size of commercial and
        military vehicles that access designated National Highway
        System intermodal freight terminals;
          (F) the connection between land use and infrastructure is
        significant;
          (G) transportation should play a significant role in
        promoting economic growth, improving the environment, and
        sustaining the quality of life; and
          (H) the Secretary should take appropriate actions to preserve
        and enhance the Interstate System to meet the needs of the 21st
        Century.

      (c) It is the sense of Congress that under existing law no part
    of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any
    Federal-aid system which has been apportioned pursuant to the
    provisions of this title shall be impounded or withheld from
    obligation, for purposes and projects as provided in this title, by
    any officer or employee in the executive branch of the Federal
    Government, except such specific sums as may be determined by the
    Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of
    Transportation, are necessary to be withheld from obligation for
    specific periods of time to assure that sufficient amounts will be
    available in the Highway Trust Fund to defray the expenditures
    which will be required to be made from such fund.
      (d) No funds authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust
    Fund shall be expended by or on behalf of any Federal department,
    agency, or instrumentality other than the Federal Highway
    Administration unless funds for such expenditure are identified and
    included as a line item in an appropriation Act and are to meet
    obligations of the United States heretofore or hereafter incurred
    under this title attributable to the construction of Federal-aid
    highways or highway planning, research, or development, or as
    otherwise specifically authorized to be appropriated from the
    Highway Trust Fund by Federal-aid highway legislation.
      (e) It is the national policy that to the maximum extent possible
    the procedures to be utilized by the Secretary and all other
    affected heads of Federal departments, agencies, and
    instrumentalities for carrying out this title and any other
    provision of law relating to the Federal highway programs shall
    encourage the substantial minimization of paperwork and interagency
    decision procedures and the best use of available manpower and
    funds so as to prevent needless duplication and unnecessary delays
    at all levels of government.

      Pub. L. 109-59, title I, Sec. 1301, Aug. 10, 2005, 119 Stat.
    1198, as amended by Pub. L. 110-244, title I, Sec. 103(a), June 6,
    2008, 122 Stat. 1578, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Under current law, surface transportation programs rely
      primarily on formula capital apportionments to States.
        "(2) Despite the significant increase for surface
      transportation program funding in the Transportation Equity Act
      of the 21st Century [Pub. L. 105-178, see Tables for
      classification], current levels of investment are insufficient to
      fund critical high-cost transportation infrastructure facilities
      that address critical national economic and transportation needs.
        "(3) Critical high-cost transportation infrastructure
      facilities often include multiple levels of government, agencies,
      modes of transportation, and transportation goals and planning
      processes that are not easily addressed or funded within existing
      surface transportation program categories.
        "(4) Projects of national and regional significance have
      national and regional benefits, including improving economic
      productivity by facilitating international trade, relieving
      congestion, and improving transportation safety by facilitating
      passenger and freight movement.
        "(5) The benefits of projects described in paragraph (4) accrue
      to local areas, States, and the Nation as a result of the effect
      such projects have on the national transportation system.
        "(6) A program dedicated to constructing projects of national
      and regional significance is necessary to improve the safe,
      secure, and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the
      United States and improve the health and welfare of the national
      economy.
      "(b) Establishment of Program. - The Secretary [of
    Transportation] shall establish a program to provide grants to
    States for projects of national and regional significance.
      "(c) Definitions. - In this section, the following definitions
    apply:
        "(1) Eligible project costs. - The term 'eligible project
      costs' means the costs of - 
          "(A) development phase activities, including planning,
        feasibility analysis, revenue forecasting, environmental
        review, preliminary engineering and design work, and other
        preconstruction activities; and
          "(B) construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and
        acquisition of real property (including land related to the
        project and improvements to land), environmental mitigation,
        construction contingencies, acquisition of equipment, and
        operational improvements.
        "(2) Eligible project. - The term 'eligible project' means any
      surface transportation project eligible for Federal assistance
      under title 23, United States Code, including freight railroad
      projects and activities eligible under such title.
        "(3) State. - The term 'State' has the meaning such term has in
      section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code.
      "(d) Eligibility. - To be eligible for assistance under this
    section, a project shall have eligible project costs that are
    reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed the lesser of - 
        "(1) $500,000,000; or
        "(2) 75 percent of the amount of Federal highway assistance
      funds apportioned for the most recently completed fiscal year to
      the State in which the project is located.
      "(e) Applications. - Each State seeking to receive a grant under
    this section for an eligible project shall submit to the Secretary
    [of Transportation] an application in such form and in accordance
    with such requirements as the Secretary shall establish.
      "(f) Competitive Grant Selection and Criteria for Grants. - 
        "(1) In general. - The Secretary [of Transportation] shall -

          "(C) award grants on a competitive basis.
        "(2) Criteria for grants. - The Secretary may approve a grant
      under this section for a project only if the Secretary determines
      that the project - 
          "(A) is based on the results of preliminary engineering;
          "(B) is justified based on the ability of the project - 
            "(i) to generate national economic benefits, including
          creating jobs, expanding business opportunities, and
          impacting the gross domestic product;
            "(ii) to reduce congestion, including impacts in the State,
          region, and Nation;
            "(iii) to improve transportation safety, including reducing
          transportation accidents, injuries, and fatalities;

          financing sources to construct, maintain, and operate the
          infrastructure facility; and
          "(C) is supported by an acceptable degree of non-Federal
        financial commitments, including evidence of stable and
        dependable financing sources to construct, maintain, and
        operate the infrastructure facility.
        "(3) Selection considerations. - In selecting a project under
      this section, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which
      the project - 
          "(A) leverages Federal investment by encouraging non-Federal
        contributions to the project, including contributions from
        public-private partnerships;
          "(B) uses new technologies, including intelligent
        transportation systems, that enhance the efficiency of the
        project; and
          "(C) helps maintain or protect the environment.
        "(4) Preliminary engineering. - In evaluating a project under
      paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall analyze and consider the

        "(5) Non-federal financial commitment. - 
          "(A) Evaluation of project. - In evaluating a project under
        paragraph (2)(C), the Secretary shall require that -

          availability of contingency amounts that the Secretary
          determines to be reasonable to cover unanticipated cost
          increases; and
            "(ii) each proposed non-Federal source of capital and
          operating financing is stable, reliable, and available within
          the proposed project timetable.
          "(B) Considerations. - In assessing the stability,
        reliability, and availability of proposed sources of non-
        Federal financing under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall
        consider -

          the recipient for the proposed project; and
            "(iv) the extent to which the project has a non-Federal
          financial commitment that exceeds the required non-Federal

      equivalent to the last 2 fiscal years of funding authorized to
      carry out this section less an amount the Secretary reasonably
      estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered
      by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and
      contingent commitments included in full funding grant agreements
      may be not more than a limitation specified in law.

      Transportation] shall require that all grants under this section
      be subject to all terms, conditions, and requirements that the
      Secretary decides are necessary or appropriate for purposes of
      this section, including requirements for the disposition of net
      increases in value of real property resulting from the project
      assisted under this section.
      "(i) Government's Share of Project Cost. - Based on engineering
    studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the
    expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary [of
    Transportation] shall estimate the cost of a project receiving
    assistance under this section. A grant for the project is for 80
    percent of the project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a
    lower grant percentage. A refund or reduction of the remainder may
    be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of the grant of
    the Government is made at the same time.
      "(j) Fiscal Capacity Considerations. - If the Secretary [of
    Transportation] gives priority consideration to financing projects
    that include more than the non-Government share required under
    subsection (i) the Secretary shall give equal consideration to
    differences in the fiscal capacity of State and local governments.
      "(k) Reports. - 
        "(1) Annual report. - Not later than the first Monday in
      February of each year, the Secretary [of Transportation] shall

      Public Works of the Senate a report that includes a proposal on
      the allocation of amounts to be made available to finance grants
      under this section.
        "(2) Recommendations on funding. - The annual report under this
      paragraph [subsection] shall include evaluations and ratings, as
      required under subsection (f). The report shall also include
      recommendations of projects for funding based on the evaluations
      and ratings and on existing commitments and anticipated funding
      levels for the next 3 fiscal years and for the next 10 fiscal
      years based on information currently available to the Secretary.
      "(l) Applicability of Title 23. - Funds made available to carry
    out this section shall be available for obligation in the same
    manner as if such funds were apportioned under chapter 1 of title
    23, United States Code; except that such funds shall not be

    any provision of law relating to highway safety enacted after May
    1, 1966. Beginning with funds authorized to be appropriated for
    fiscal year 1980, no such funds shall be available for projects to
    expand or clear zones immediately adjacent to the paved roadway of
    routes designed prior to February, 1967. Effective on and after the
    date of enactment of this sentence [Dec. 29, 1981], the obligation
    of funds authorized by this subsection, except for advance
    construction interstate projects approved before the date of
    enactment of this sentence, shall be limited to the construction
    necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the
    Interstate System which shall consist of (1) full access control;
    (2) a pavement design to accommodate the types and volumes of
    traffic anticipated for the twenty-year period from date of
    authorization of the initial basic construction contract; (3)
    essential environmental requirements; (4) a design of not more than
    six lanes (exclusive of high occupancy vehicle lanes) in rural
    areas and all urbanized areas under four hundred thousand
    population, and up to eight lanes (exclusive of high occupancy
    vehicle lanes) in urbanized areas of four hundred thousand
    population or more as shown in the 1980 Federal census; and (5)
    those high occupancy vehicle lanes (including approaches and all
    directly related facilities) included in the interstate cost
    estimate for fiscal year 1981. The obligation of funds authorized
    by this subsection shall be further limited to the actual costs of
    only those design concepts, locations, geometrics, and other
    construction features included in the 1981 interstate cost
    estimate, except in any case where the Secretary of Transportation
    determines that a provision of Federal law requires a different
    design, location, geometric, or other construction feature of a
    type authorized by this subsection. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, including any other provision of this subsection,
    where a project is to be constructed (1) to provide parking garage
    ramps in conjunction with high occupancy vehicle lanes which flow
    into a distributor system emptying directly into ramps for off-
    street parking with preferential parking for carpools, vanpools,
    and buses and the ramps are part of an environmental mitigation
    effort and are designed to feed into an aerial walkway system, or
    (2) to provide a parking lot near the terminus of an Interstate
    System spur route which radiates from an Interstate System beltway
    which will be used as an intermodal transfer facility for a light
    rail transit project to be constructed in the median of the spur
    route and the parking lot is part of an environmental mitigation
    effort, or (3) to provide a parking garage and associated
    facilities as part of an intermodal transfer facility with a
    transit system near or within an Interstate System route right-of-
    way which will have direct and indirect access to the facility by
    way of local streets and the parking garage and associated
    facilities are part of an environmental mitigation effort, or (4)
    to provide for the comprehensive upgrading of existing high
    occupancy vehicle lanes, new ramps and parking facilities at mass
    transit intermodal transfer points on an existing Interstate System
    route which has temporary high occupancy vehicle lanes in the
    median and the parking facilities and ramps are part of an
    environmental mitigation effort, the costs of such parking garage
    ramps, parking lots, parking garages, associated interchange ramps,
    high occupancy vehicle lanes, and other associated work eligible
    under title 23, United States Code, shall be eligible for funds
    authorized by this subsection as if the costs for these projects
    were included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be
    included as eligible projects in any future interstate cost
    estimate. For purposes of this subsection, construction necessary
    to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate
    System shall include, but not be limited to, any construction on
    the Interstate System which is required under a court order issued
    before the date of enactment of this sentence. Notwithstanding the
    fifth sentence of this subsection, the costs of a project which
    will upgrade an interstate route and will complete a gap on the
    Interstate System providing access to an international airport and
    which was described as the preferred alternative in a final
    environmental impact statement submitted to the Secretary of
    Transportation on September 30, 1983, shall be eligible for funds
    authorized by this subsection as if such costs were included in the
    1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be included as eligible
    costs in any future interstate cost estimate, except that (1) such
    costs may be further developed in the design and environmental
    process under normal Federal-aid interstate procedures, and (2) the
    amount of such costs shall not include the portion of the project
    between High Street and Causeway Street."
      Section 127(b) of Pub. L. 97-424 provided that: "Notwithstanding
    the provisions of section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of
    1956, as amended [set out above], the Secretary of Transportation
    may approve the expenditure of funds authorized under such section
    for the construction of a previously approved project which
    provides for improvements to and reconstruction of ramps and
    service roads which are being developed as part of a roadway system
    to relieve a severely congested segment on an Interstate route.
    Such expenditures shall be limited (1) to work necessary to provide
    more effective and safe operation of such Interstate route, and (2)
    to a section of an Interstate route which proceeded to construction
    contract prior to the date of enactment of such Act and which
    Interstate route, together with service roads, was constructed
    without the expenditure of any funds authorized by such section."

    and the principal purpose of which is to restrict the access of
    motorcycles to any highway or portion of a highway for which
    Federal-aid highway funds have been utilized for planning, design,
    construction, or maintenance. Nothing in this subsection shall
    affect the authority of a State or political subdivision of a State
    to regulate motorcycles for safety.
      (b) Engineering Cost Reimbursement. - If on-site construction of,
    or acquisition of right-of-way for, a highway project is not
    commenced within 10 years (or such longer period as the State
    requests and the Secretary determines to be reasonable) after the
    date on which Federal funds are first made available, out of the
    Highway Trust Fund (other than Mass Transit Account), for
    preliminary engineering of such project, the State shall pay an
    amount equal to the amount of Federal funds made available for such
    engineering. The Secretary shall deposit in such Fund all amounts
    paid to the Secretary under this section.

              (I) In general. - If the State or States described in
            clause (i) have not substantially completed the
            construction of a highway designated under this
            subparagraph within the time provided for under clause
            (ii), the Secretary shall remove the designation of the
            highway as a future Interstate System route.
              (II) Effect of removal. - Removal of the designation of a
            highway under subclause (I) shall not preclude the
            Secretary from designating the highway as a route on the
            Interstate System under subparagraph (A) or under any other
            provision of law providing for addition to the Interstate
            System.
              (III) Existing agreements. - An agreement described in
            clause (ii) that is entered into before the date of
            enactment of this subclause shall be deemed to include the
            25-year time limitation described in that clause,
            regardless of any earlier construction completion date in
            the agreement.

            (iv) Prohibition on referral as interstate system route. -
          No law, rule, regulation, map, document, or other record of
          the United States, or of any State or political subdivision
          of a State, shall refer to any highway designated as a future
          Interstate System route under this subparagraph, nor shall
          any such highway be signed or marked, as a highway on the
          Interstate System until such time as the highway is
          constructed to the geometric and construction standards for
          the Interstate System and has been designated as a route on
          the Interstate System.

          (C) Financial responsibility. - Except as provided in this
        title, the designation of a highway under this paragraph shall
        create no additional Federal financial responsibility with
        respect to the highway.

        (5) Exemption of interstate system. - 
          (A) In general. - Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the

    amendment by section 110 of Pub. L. 94-280 [set out in the text] as
    follows: "Upon the joint request of a State Governor and the local
    governments concerned, the Secretary may withdraw his approval of
    any route or portion thereof on the Interstate System within any
    urbanized area in that State selected and approved in accordance
    with this title prior to the enactment of this paragraph, if he
    determines that such route or portion thereof is not essential to
    completion of a unified and connected Interstate System or will no
    longer be essential by reason of the application of this paragraph
    and will not be constructed as a part of the Interstate System, and
    if he receives assurances that the State does not intend to
    construct a toll road in the traffic corridor which would be served
    by such route or portion thereof. The mileage of the route or
    portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph
    shall be available for designation on the Interstate System in any
    other State in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    After the Secretary has withdrawn his approval of any such route or
    portion thereof, whenever responsible local officials of such
    urbanized area notify the State highway department that, in lieu of
    a route or portion thereof approval for which is withdrawn under
    this paragraph, their needs require a nonhighway public mass
    transit project involving the construction of fixed rail
    facilities, or the purchase of passenger equipment, including
    rolling stock for any mode of mass transit, or both, and the State
    highway department determines that such public mass transit project
    is in accordance with the planning process under section 134 of
    this title and is entitled to priority under such planning process,
    such public mass transit project shall be submitted for approval to
    the Secretary. Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates
    for such project by the Secretary shall be deemed a contractual
    obligation of the United States for payment out of the general
    funds in the Treasury of its proportional share of the cost of such
    project in an amount equal to the Federal share which would be paid
    for such a project under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964
    [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation], except that the
    total Federal cost of all such projects under this paragraph with
    respect to such route or portion thereof approval of which is
    withdrawn under this paragraph, shall not exceed the Federal share
    of the cost which would have been paid for such route or portion
    thereof, as such cost is included in the 1972 Interstate System
    cost estimate set forth in table 5 of House Public Works Committee
    Print Numbered 92-29, as revised in House Report Numbered 92-1443,
    increased or decreased, as the case may be, as determined by the
    Secretary, based on changes in construction costs of such route or
    portion thereof as of the date of withdrawal of approval under this
    paragraph and in accordance with that design of such route or
    portion thereof which is the basis of such 1972 cost estimate.
    Funds apportioned to such State for the Interstate System, which
    apportionment is based upon an Interstate System cost estimate that
    includes a route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn
    under this paragraph, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
    Federal share of such project as such share becomes a contractual
    obligation of the United States. No general funds shall be
    obligated under authority of this paragraph after June 30, 1981. No
    nonhighway public mass transit project shall be approved under this
    paragraph unless the Secretary has received assurances satisfactory
    to him from the State that public mass transportation systems will
    fully utilize the proposed project. The provision of assistance
    under this paragraph shall not be construed as bringing within the
    application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code [section
    1501 et seq. of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees],
    any nonsupervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system
    (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to
    whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable. Funds available for
    expenditure to carry out the purposes of this paragraph shall be
    supplementary to and not in substitution for funds authorized and
    available for obligation pursuant to the Urban Mass Transportation
    Act of 1964, as amended [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49,
    Transportation]. The provisions of section 3(e)(4) of the Urban
    Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, [section 1602 (e)(4)
    of Title 49], shall apply in carrying out this paragraph."

    the Federal-aid primary system (including extensions in urban areas

    for each State the higher of (1) the amount which would be
    apportioned to such State under section 104(b)(1) of title 23,
    United States Code, and (2) the amount which would be apportioned
    to such State under the following formula:
        "One-half in the ratio which the population of rural areas of
      each State bears to the total population of rural areas of all
      the States as shown by the latest available Federal census and
      one-half in the ratio which the population in urban areas in each

    system bears to the total of such amounts determined under
    subsection (a) for such fiscal year.
      "(c) The amount which shall be apportioned to each State for the
    Federal-aid primary system (including extensions in urban areas and

    1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991 shall be the amount
    determined for such State under subsection (a), multiplied by the
    ratio determined under subsection (b).
      "(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no State shall
    receive an apportionment under this section for any fiscal year
    which is less than the lower of (1) the amount which the State
    would be apportioned for such fiscal year under section 104(b)(1)

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no State shall receive

    purposes of this paragraph and subsection (b) of section 103 of
    title 23, United States Code, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American
    Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall
    be considered together as one State. The State consisting of the
    Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the
    Mariana Islands shall not receive less than one-half of 1 per
    centum of each year's apportionment. There are authorized to be
    appropriated such sums as may be necessary out of the Highway Trust
    Fund to carry out this subsection. Funds authorized by this
    subsection shall be available for obligation in the same manner and
    to the same extent as if such funds were apportioned under chapter
    1 of title 23, United States Code.
      "(e) Amounts apportioned under this section shall be deemed to be
    amounts apportioned under section 104(b)(1) of title 23, United
    States Code, for purposes of such title and all other provisions of
    law. Terms used in this section shall have the same meaning such

        "(3) determine the ratio that - 
          "(A) the obligation limitation for Federal-aid highways, less
        the aggregate of amounts not distributed under paragraphs (1)
        and (2), bears to
          "(B) the total of the sums authorized to be appropriated for
        Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs
        (other than sums authorized to be appropriated for provisions
        of law described in paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection
        (b) and sums authorized to be appropriated for section 105 of
        title 23, United States Code, equal to the amount referred to

        of the amounts not distributed under paragraphs (1) and (2) of
        this subsection;
        "(4)(A) distribute the obligation limitation for Federal-aid
      highways, less the aggregate amounts not distributed under

      A Legacy for Users [Pub. L. 109-59]; section 117 and section
      144(g) [now 144(f)] of title 23, United States Code; and section
      14501 of title 40, United States Code, so that the amount of
      obligation authority available for each of such sections is equal
      to the amount determined by multiplying the ratio determined
      under paragraph (3) by the sums authorized to be appropriated for
      that section for the fiscal year; and
        "(B) distribute $2,000,000,000 for section 105 of title 23,
      United States Code;
        "(5) distribute the obligation limitation provided for Federal-
      aid highways, less the aggregate amounts not distributed under
      paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts distributed under paragraph
      (4), for each of the programs that are allocated by the Secretary
      under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation
      Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [Pub. L. 109-59, see Tables for
      classification] and title 23, United States Code (other than to
      programs to which paragraphs (1) and (4) apply), by multiplying
      the ratio determined under paragraph (3) by the amounts
      authorized to be appropriated for each such program for such
      fiscal year; and
        "(6) distribute the obligation limitation provided for Federal-
      aid highways, less the aggregate amounts not distributed under
      paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts distributed under paragraphs
      (4) and (5), for Federal-aid highways and highway safety
      construction programs (other than the amounts apportioned for the
      equity bonus program, but only to the extent that the amounts
      apportioned for the equity bonus program for the fiscal year are
      greater than $2,639,000,000, and the Appalachian development
      highway system program) that are apportioned by the Secretary
      under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation
      Equity Act: A Legacy for Users and title 23, United States Code,
      in the ratio that - 
          "(A) amounts authorized to be appropriated for such programs
        that are apportioned to each State for such fiscal year, bear
        to
          "(B) the total of the amounts authorized to be appropriated
        for such programs that are apportioned to all States for such
        fiscal year.

    limitation for Federal-aid highways shall not apply to obligations:

      Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 [Pub. L. 102-240, see

      effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the
      Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century [June 9, 1998];

      authority was made available under the Transportation Equity Act
      for the 21st Century [Pub. L. 105-178, see Tables for
      classification] or subsequent public laws for multiple years or
      to remain available until used, but only to the extent that the

      Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users [Pub. L.
      109-59, set out as a note under section 118 of this title], to
      the extent that funds obligated in accordance with that section
      were not subject to a limitation on obligations at the time at
      which the funds were initially made available for obligation.
      "(c) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority. -
    Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Secretary shall, after August 1
    of such fiscal year, revise a distribution of the obligation
    limitation made available under subsection (a) if the amount
    distributed cannot be obligated during that fiscal year, and
    redistribute sufficient amounts to those States able to obligate
    amounts in addition to those previously distributed during that

      "(d) Applicability of Obligation Limitations to Transportation
    Research Programs. - The obligation limitation shall apply to

    Legacy for Users [Pub. L. 109-59, see Tables for classification],
    except that obligation authority made available for such programs
    under such limitation shall remain available for a period of 3
    fiscal years and shall be in addition to the amount of any
    limitation imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and
    highway safety construction programs for future fiscal years.
      "(e) Redistribution of Certain Authorized Funds. - 
        "(1) In general. - Not later than 30 days after the date of the

      Secretary shall distribute to the States any funds that - 
          "(A) are authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year
        for Federal-aid highways programs; and
          "(B) the Secretary determines will not be allocated to the
        States, and will not be available for obligation, in such
        fiscal year due to the imposition of any obligation limitation
        for such fiscal year.
        "(2) Ratio. - Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) in
      the same ratio as the distribution of obligation authority under

      shall be available for any purposes described in section 133(b)

      obligations for Federal-aid highway and highway safety

    acquire lands or interests in lands (including within the term
    "interests in lands", the control of access thereto from adjoining
    lands) required by such State for right-of-way or other purposes in
    connection with the prosecution of any project for the
    construction, reconstruction, or improvement of any section of the
    Interstate System, the Secretary is authorized, in the name of the
    United States and prior to the approval of title by the Attorney
    General, to acquire, enter upon, and take possession of such lands
    or interests in lands by purchase, donation, condemnation, or
    otherwise in accordance with the laws of the United States
    (including sections 3114 to 3116 and 3118 of title 40), if - 
        (1) the Secretary has determined either that the State is
      unable to acquire necessary lands or interests in lands, or is
      unable to acquire such lands or interests in lands with
      sufficient promptness; and
        (2) the State has agreed with the Secretary to pay, at such
      time as may be specified by the Secretary an amount equal to 10
      per centum of the costs incurred by the Secretary, in acquiring
      such lands or interests in lands, or such lesser percentage which
      represents the State's pro rata share of project costs as
      determined in accordance with subsection (c) (!1) of section 120
      of this title.


      The authority granted by this section shall also apply to lands
    and interests in lands received as grants of land from the United
    States and owned or held by railroads or other corporations.
      (b) The costs incurred by the Secretary in acquiring any such
    lands or interests in lands may include the cost of examination and
    abstract of title, certificate of title, advertising, and any fees
    incidental to such acquisition. All costs incurred by the Secretary
    in connection with the acquisition of any such lands or interests
    in lands shall be paid from the funds for construction,
    reconstruction, or improvement of the Interstate System apportioned
    to the State upon the request of which such lands or interests in
    lands are acquired, and any sums paid to the Secretary by such
    State as its share of the costs of acquisition of such lands or
    interests in lands shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit
    of the appropriation for Federal-aid highways and shall be credited
    to the amount apportioned to such State as its apportionment of
    funds for construction, reconstruction, or improvement of the
    Interstate System, or shall be deducted from other moneys due the
    State for reimbursement from funds authorized to be appropriated
    under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.
      (c) The Secretary is further authorized and directed by proper
    deed, executed in the name of the United States, to convey any such
    lands or interests in lands acquired in any State under the
    provisions of this section, except the outside five feet of any
    such right-of-way in any State which does not provide control of
    access, to the State transportation department of such State or
    such political subdivision thereof as its laws may provide, upon
    such terms and conditions as to such lands or interests in lands as
    may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State transportation
    department or political subdivisions to which the conveyance is to
    be made. Whenever the State makes provision for control of access
    satisfactory to the Secretary, the outside five feet then shall be
    conveyed to the State by the Secretary, as herein provided.
      (d) Whenever rights-of-way, including control of access, on the
    Interstate System are required over lands or interests in lands
    owned by the United States, the Secretary may make such
    arrangements with the agency having jurisdiction over such lands as
    may be necessary to give the State or other person constructing the
    projects on such lands adequate rights-of-way and control of access
    thereto from adjoining lands, and any such agency is directed to
    cooperate with the Secretary in this connection.

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 109. Standards

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary shall ensure that the plans and
    specifications for each proposed highway project under this chapter
    provide for a facility that will - 
        (1) adequately serve the existing and planned future traffic of
      the highway in a manner that is conducive to safety, durability,
      and economy of maintenance; and
        (2) be designed and constructed in accordance with criteria
      best suited to accomplish the objectives described in paragraph
      (1) and to conform to the particular needs of each locality.

      (b) The geometric and construction standards to be adopted for
    the Interstate System shall be those approved by the Secretary in
    cooperation with the State transportation departments. Such
    standards, as applied to each actual construction project, shall be
    adequate to enable such project to accommodate the types and
    volumes of traffic anticipated for such project for the twenty-year
    period commencing on the date of approval by the Secretary, under
    section 106 of this title, of the plans, specifications, and
    estimates for actual construction of such project. Such standards
    shall in all cases provide for at least four lanes of traffic. The
    right-of-way width of the Interstate System shall be adequate to
    permit construction of projects on the Interstate System to such
    standards. The Secretary shall apply such standards uniformly
    throughout all the States.
      (c) Design Criteria for National Highway System. - 
        (1) In general. - A design for new construction,
      reconstruction, resurfacing (except for maintenance resurfacing),
      restoration, or rehabilitation of a highway on the National
      Highway System (other than a highway also on the Interstate
      System) may take into account, in addition to the criteria
      described in subsection (a) - 
          (A) the constructed and natural environment of the area;
          (B) the environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic,
        community, and preservation impacts of the activity; and
          (C) access for other modes of transportation.

        (2) Development of criteria. - The Secretary, in cooperation
      with State transportation departments, may develop criteria to
      implement paragraph (1). In developing criteria under this
      paragraph, the Secretary shall consider - 
          (A) the results of the committee process of the American
        Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials as
        used in adopting and publishing "A Policy on Geometric Design
        of Highways and Streets", including comments submitted by
        interested parties as part of such process;
          (B) the publication entitled "Flexibility in Highway Design"
        of the Federal Highway Administration;
          (C) "Eight Characteristics of Process to Yield Excellence and
        the Seven Qualities of Excellence in Transportation Design"
        developed by the conference held during 1998 entitled "Thinking
        Beyond the Pavement National Workshop on Integrating Highway
        Development with Communities and the Environment while
        Maintaining Safety and Performance"; and
          (D) any other material that the Secretary determines to be
        appropriate.

      (d) On any highway project in which Federal funds hereafter
    participate, or on any such project constructed since December 20,
    1944, the location, form and character of informational, regulatory
    and warning signs, curb and pavement or other markings, and traffic
    signals installed or placed by any public authority or other
    agency, shall be subject to the approval of the State
    transportation department with the concurrence of the Secretary,
    who is directed to concur only in such installations as will
    promote the safe and efficient utilization of the highways.
      (e) Installation of Safety Devices. - 
        (1) Highway and railroad grade crossings and drawbridges. - No
      funds shall be approved for expenditure on any Federal-aid
      highway, or highway affected under chapter 2 of this title,
      unless proper safety protective devices complying with safety
      standards determined by the Secretary at that time as being
      adequate shall be installed or be in operation at any highway and
      railroad grade crossing or drawbridge on that portion of the
      highway with respect to which such expenditures are to be made.
        (2) Temporary traffic control devices. - No funds shall be
      approved for expenditure on any Federal-aid highway, or highway
      affected under chapter 2, unless proper temporary traffic control
      devices to improve safety in work zones will be installed and
      maintained during construction, utility, and maintenance
      operations on that portion of the highway with respect to which
      such expenditures are to be made. Installation and maintenance of
      the devices shall be in accordance with the Manual on Uniform
      Traffic Control Devices.

      (f) The Secretary shall not, as a condition precedent to his
    approval under section 106 of this title, require any State to
    acquire title to, or control of, any marginal land along the
    proposed highway in addition to that reasonably necessary for road
    surfaces, median strips, bikeways, gutters, ditches, and side
    slopes, and of sufficient width to provide service roads for
    adjacent property to permit safe access at controlled locations in
    order to expedite traffic, promote safety, and minimize roadside
    parking.
      (g) Not later than January 30, 1971, the Secretary shall issue
    guidelines for minimizing possible soil erosion from highway
    construction. Such guidelines shall apply to all proposed projects
    with respect to which plans, specifications, and estimates are
    approved by the Secretary after the issuance of such guidelines.
      (h) Not later than July 1, 1972, the Secretary, after
    consultation with appropriate Federal and State officials, shall
    submit to Congress, and not later than 90 days after such
    submission, promulgate guidelines designed to assure that possible
    adverse economic, social, and environmental effects relating to any
    proposed project on any Federal-aid system have been fully
    considered in developing such project, and that the final decisions
    on the project are made in the best overall public interest, taking
    into consideration the need for fast, safe and efficient
    transportation, public services, and the costs of eliminating or
    minimizing such adverse effects and the following:
        (1) air, noise, and water pollution;
        (2) destruction or disruption of man-made and natural
      resources, aesthetic values, community cohesion and the
      availability of public facilities and services;
        (3) adverse employment effects, and tax and property value
      losses;
        (4) injurious displacement of people, businesses and farms; and
        (5) disruption of desirable community and regional growth.

    Such guidelines shall apply to all proposed projects with respect
    to which plans, specifications, and estimates are approved by the
    Secretary after the issuance of such guidelines.
      (i) The Secretary, after consultation with appropriate Federal,
    State, and local officials, shall develop and promulgate standards
    for highway noise levels compatible with different land uses and
    after July 1, 1972, shall not approve plans and specifications for
    any proposed project on any Federal-aid system for which location
    approval has not yet been secured unless he determines that such
    plans and specifications include adequate measures to implement the
    appropriate noise level standards. The Secretary, after
    consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
    Agency and appropriate Federal, State, and local officials, may
    promulgate standards for the control of highway noise levels for
    highways on any Federal-aid system for which project approval has
    been secured prior to July 1, 1972. The Secretary may approve any
    project on a Federal-aid system to which noise-level standards are
    made applicable under the preceding sentence for the purpose of
    carrying out such standards. Such project may include, but is not
    limited to, the acquisition of additional rights-of-way, the
    construction of physical barriers, and landscaping. Sums
    apportioned for the Federal-aid system on which such project will
    be located shall be available to finance the Federal share of such
    project. Such project shall be deemed a highway project for all
    purposes of this title.
      (j) The Secretary, after consultation with the Administrator of
    the Environmental Protection Agency, shall develop and promulgate
    guidelines to assure that highways constructed pursuant to this
    title are consistent with any approved plan for - 
        (1) the implementation of a national ambient air quality
      standard for each pollutant for which an area is designated as a
      nonattainment area under section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act (42
      U.S.C. 7407(d)); or
        (2) the maintenance of a national ambient air quality standard
      in an area that was designated as a nonattainment area but that
      was later redesignated by the Administrator as an attainment area
      for the standard and that is required to develop a maintenance
      plan under section 175A of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7505a).

      (k) The Secretary shall not approve any project involving
    approaches to a bridge under this title, if such project and bridge
    will significantly affect the traffic volume and the highway system
    of a contiguous State without first taking into full consideration
    the views of that State.
      (l)(1) In determining whether any right-of-way on any Federal-aid
    highway should be used for accommodating any utility facility, the
    Secretary shall - 
        (A) first ascertain the effect such use will have on highway
      and traffic safety, since in no case shall any use be authorized
      or otherwise permitted, under this or any other provision of law,
      which would adversely affect safety;
        (B) evaluate the direct and indirect environmental and economic
      effects of any loss of productive agricultural land or any
      impairment of the productivity of any agricultural land which
      would result from the disapproval of the use of such right-of-way
      for the accommodation of such utility facility; and
        (C) consider such environmental and economic effects together
      with any interference with or impairment of the use of the
      highway in such right-of-way which would result from the use of
      such right-of-way for the accommodation of such utility facility.

      (2) For the purpose of this subsection - 
        (A) the term "utility facility" means any privately, publicly,
      or cooperatively owned line, facility, or system for producing,
      transmitting, or distributing communications, power, electricity,
      light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, water, steam, waste, storm
      water not connected with highway drainage, or any other similar
      commodity, including any fire or police signal system or street
      lighting system, which directly or indirectly serves the public;
      and
        (B) the term "right-of-way" means any real property, or
      interest therein, acquired, dedicated, or reserved for the
      construction, operation, and maintenance of a highway.

      (m) Protection of Nonmotorized Transportation Traffic. - The
    Secretary shall not approve any project or take any regulatory
    action under this title that will result in the severance of an
    existing major route or have significant adverse impact on the
    safety for nonmotorized transportation traffic and light
    motorcycles, unless such project or regulatory action provides for
    a reasonable alternate route or such a route exists.
      (n) It is the intent of Congress that any project for
    resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitating any highway, other than a
    highway access to which is fully controlled, in which Federal funds
    participate shall be constructed in accordance with standards to
    preserve and extend the service life of highways and enhance
    highway safety.
      (o) Compliance With State Laws for Non-NHS Projects. - Projects
    (other than highway projects on the National Highway System) shall
    be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance
    with State laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design
    standards, and construction standards.
      (p) Scenic and Historic Values. - Notwithstanding subsections (b)
    and (c), the Secretary may approve a project for the National
    Highway System if the project is designed to - 
        (1) allow for the preservation of environmental, scenic, or
      historic values;
        (2) ensure safe use of the facility; and
        (3) comply with subsection (a).

      (q) Phase Construction. - Safety considerations for a project
    under this title may be met by phase construction consistent with
    the operative safety management system established in accordance
    with section 303 or in accordance with a statewide transportation
    improvement program approved by the Secretary.

    for the Interstate and National Highway System program, the bridge
    program, the surface transportation program, the highway safety
    improvement program, and the congestion mitigation air quality

-HEAD-
    Sec. 111. Agreements relating to use of and access to rights-of-way
      - Interstate System

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - All agreements between the Secretary and the
    State transportation department for the construction of projects on
    the Interstate System shall contain a clause providing that the
    State will not add any points of access to, or exit from, the
    project in addition to those approved by the Secretary in the plans
    for such project, without the prior approval of the Secretary. Such
    agreements shall also contain a clause providing that the State
    will not permit automotive service stations or other commercial
    establishments for serving motor vehicle users to be constructed or
    located on the rights-of-way of the Interstate System. Such
    agreements may, however, authorize a State or political subdivision
    thereof to use or permit the use of the airspace above and below
    the established grade line of the highway pavement for such
    purposes as will not impair the full use and safety of the highway,
    as will not require or permit vehicular access to such space
    directly from such established grade line of the highway, or
    otherwise interfere in any way with the free flow of traffic on the
    Interstate System. Nothing in this section, or in any agreement
    entered into under this section, shall require the discontinuance,
    obstruction, or removal of any establishment for serving motor
    vehicle users on any highway which has been, or is hereafter,
    designated as a highway or route on the Interstate System (1) if
    such establishment (A) was in existence before January 1, 1960, (B)
    is owned by a State, and (C) is operated through concessionaries or
    otherwise, and (2) if all access to, and exits from, such
    establishment conform to the standards established for such a
    highway under this title.
      (b) Vending Machines. - Notwithstanding subsection (a), any State
    may permit the placement of vending machines in rest and recreation
    areas, and in safety rest areas, constructed or located on rights-
    of-way of the Interstate System in such State. Such vending
    machines may only dispense such food, drink, and other articles as
    the State transportation department determines are appropriate and
    desirable. Such vending machines may only be operated by the State.
    In permitting the placement of vending machines, the State shall
    give priority to vending machines which are operated through the
    State licensing agency designated pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of
    the Act of June 20, 1936, commonly known as the "Randolph-Sheppard
    Act" (20 U.S.C. 107a(a)(5)). The costs of installation, operation,
    and maintenance of vending machines shall not be eligible for
    Federal assistance under this title.
      (c) Motorist Call Boxes. - 
        (1) In general. - Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State may
      permit the placement of motorist call boxes on rights-of-way of
      the National Highway System. Such motorist call boxes may include
      the identification and sponsorship logos of such call boxes.
        (2) Sponsorship logos. - 
          (A) Approval by state and local agencies. - All call box
        installations displaying sponsorship logos under this
        subsection shall be approved by the highway agencies having
        jurisdiction of the highway on which they are located.
          (B) Size on box. - A sponsorship logo may be placed on the
        call box in a dimension not to exceed the size of the call box
        or a total dimension in excess of 12 inches by 18 inches.
          (C) Size on identification sign. - Sponsorship logos in a
        dimension not to exceed 12 inches by 30 inches may be displayed
        on a call box identification sign affixed to the call box post.
          (D) Spacing of signs. - Sponsorship logos affixed to an
        identification sign on a call box post may be located on the
        rights-of-way at intervals not more frequently than 1 per every
        5 miles.
          (E) Distribution throughout state. - Within a State, at least
        20 percent of the call boxes displaying sponsorship logos shall
        be located on highways outside of urbanized areas with a
        population greater than 50,000.

        (3) Nonsafety hazards. - The call boxes and their location,
      posts, foundations, and mountings shall be consistent with
      requirements of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices or
      any requirements deemed necessary by the Secretary to assure that
      the call boxes shall not be a safety hazard to motorists.

     VENDING MACHINES; PLACEMENT IN REST, RECREATION, AND SAFETY REST
                    AREAS; STATE OPERATION OF MACHINES
      Pub. L. 97-424, title I, Sec. 111, Jan. 6, 1983, 96 Stat. 2106,
    provided that notwithstanding section 111 of this title before Oct.
    1, 1983, any State could permit placement of vending machines in
    rest and recreation areas and in safety rest areas constructed or
    located on rights-of-way of National System of Interstate and
    Defense Highways [now Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and
    Defense Highways] in such State. Such vending machines could only
    dispense such food, drink, and other articles as the State highway
    department determined were appropriate and desirable. Such vending
    machines could only be operated by the State. In permitting the
    placement of vending machines under this section, the State had to
    give priority to vending machines which were operated through the
    State licensing agency designated pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of
    the Act of June 20, 1936, known as the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20
    U.S.C. 107a(a)(5)).

    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 112. Letting of contracts

-STATUTE-
      (a) In all cases where the construction is to be performed by the
    State transportation department or under its supervision, a request
    for submission of bids shall be made by advertisement unless some
    other method is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall
    require such plans and specifications and such methods of bidding
    as shall be effective in securing competition.
      (b) Bidding Requirements. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3),
      construction of each project, subject to the provisions of
      subsection (a) of this section, shall be performed by contract
      awarded by competitive bidding, unless the State transportation
      department demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary,
      that some other method is more cost effective or that an
      emergency exists. Contracts for the construction of each project
      shall be awarded only on the basis of the lowest responsive bid
      submitted by a bidder meeting established criteria of
      responsibility. No requirement or obligation shall be imposed as
      a condition precedent to the award of a contract to such bidder
      for a project, or to the Secretary's concurrence in the award of
      a contract to such bidder, unless such requirement or obligation
      is otherwise lawful and is specifically set forth in the
      advertised specifications.
        (2) Contracting for engineering and design services. - 
          (A) General rule. - Subject to paragraph (3), each contract
        for program management, construction management, feasibility

        surveying, mapping, or architectural related services with
        respect to a project subject to the provisions of subsection
        (a) of this section shall be awarded in the same manner as a
        contract for architectural and engineering services is
        negotiated under chapter 11 of title 40.
          (B) Performance and audits. - Any contract or subcontract
        awarded in accordance with subparagraph (A), whether funded in
        whole or in part with Federal-aid highway funds, shall be
        performed and audited in compliance with cost principles
        contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulations of part 31 of
        title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.
          (C) Indirect cost rates. - Instead of performing its own
        audits, a recipient of funds under a contract or subcontract
        awarded in accordance with subparagraph (A) shall accept
        indirect cost rates established in accordance with the Federal
        Acquisition Regulations for 1-year applicable accounting
        periods by a cognizant Federal or State government agency, if
        such rates are not currently under dispute.
          (D) Application of rates. - Once a firm's indirect cost rates
        are accepted under this paragraph, the recipient of the funds
        shall apply such rates for the purposes of contract estimation,
        negotiation, administration, reporting, and contract payment
        and shall not be limited by administrative or de facto ceilings
        of any kind.
          (E) Prenotification; confidentiality of data. - A recipient
        of funds requesting or using the cost and rate data described
        in subparagraph (D) shall notify any affected firm before such
        request or use. Such data shall be confidential and shall not
        be accessible or provided, in whole or in part, to another firm
        or to any government agency which is not part of the group of
        agencies sharing cost data under this paragraph, except by
        written permission of the audited firm. If prohibited by law,
        such cost and rate data shall not be disclosed under any
        circumstances.
          (F)(F) (!1) Subparagraphs (B), (C), (D) and (E) herein shall
        not apply to the States of West Virginia or Minnesota.

        build contract, a franchise agreement, or any other form of
        contract approved by the Secretary.

      (c) The Secretary shall require as a condition precedent to his
    approval of each contract awarded by competitive bidding pursuant
    to subsection (b) of this section, and subject to the provisions of
    this section, a sworn statement, executed by, or on behalf of, the
    person, firm, association, or corporation to whom such contract is
    to be awarded, certifying that such person, firm, association, or
    corporation has not, either directly or indirectly, entered into
    any agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise taken

    contract, the services of a consultant to prepare any environmental
    impact assessments or analyses required for a project, including
    environmental impact statements, as well as subsequent engineering
    and design work on the project if the State conducts a review that

-STATUTE-
      (a) It shall be the duty of the State transportation department
    to maintain, or cause to be maintained, any project constructed
    under the provisions of this chapter or constructed under the
    provisions of prior Acts. The State's obligation to the United
    States to maintain any such project shall cease when it no longer
    constitutes a part of a Federal-aid system.
      (b) In any State wherein the State transportation department is
    without legal authority to maintain a project constructed on the
    Federal-aid secondary system, or within a municipality, such
    transportation department shall enter into a formal agreement for
    its maintenance with the appropriate officials of the county or
    municipality in which such project is located.
      (c) If at any time the Secretary shall find that any project
    constructed under the provisions of this chapter, or constructed
    under the provisions of prior Acts, is not being properly
    maintained, he shall call such fact to the attention of the State
    transportation department. If, within ninety days after receipt of
    such notice, such project has not been put in proper condition of
    maintenance, the Secretary shall withhold approval of further
    projects of all types in the State highway district, municipality,
    county, other political or administrative subdivision of the State,
    or the entire State in which such project is located, whichever the
    Secretary deems most appropriate, until such project shall have
    been put in proper condition of maintenance.
      (d) Preventive Maintenance. - A preventive maintenance activity
    shall be eligible for Federal assistance under this title if the
    State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the
    activity is a cost-effective means of extending the useful life of
    a Federal-aid highway.

        obligate in the fiscal year all of its apportionments under
        section 104(b)(4) other than an amount that, by itself, is
        insufficient to pay the Federal share of the cost of a project
        for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing
        the Interstate System that has been submitted by the State to
        the Secretary for approval; and

            (iii) in the case of construction work, begin work within
          90 days after obligation.

        (3) Priority consideration for certain projects. - In selecting
      projects to fund under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall give
      priority consideration to any project the cost of which exceeds
      $10,000,000 on any high volume route in an urban area or a high
      truck-volume route in a rural area.
        (4) Period of availability of discretionary funds. - Sums made

      fiscal years is obligated.
        (2) Released funds. - Any funds released by the final payment
      for a project, or by modifying the project agreement for a
      project, shall be - 
          (A) credited to the same class of funds previously
        apportioned or allocated to the State for the project; and
          (B) immediately available for obligation.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - 
        (1) Projects. - The Secretary may approve projects for
      resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing - 
          (A) routes on the Interstate System designated under section
        103(c)(1) and, in Alaska and Puerto Rico, under section
        103(c)(4)(A);
          (B) routes on the Interstate System designated before the
        date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st

      a Secretarial agreement provided for in section 129 or continued
      in effect by section 1012(d) of the Intermodal Surface
      Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Stat. 1939) and not
      voided by the Secretary under section 120(c) of the Surface

    costs of construction of segments of the Interstate System open to
    traffic in such State (other than high occupancy vehicle lanes)
    included in the most recent interstate cost estimate. Upon transfer
    of such amount, the construction on which such amount is based on
    open-to-traffic segments of the Interstate System in such State as
    included in the latest interstate cost estimate shall be ineligible
    and shall not be included in future interstate cost estimates
    approved or adjusted under section 104(b)(5)(A) (as in effect on

      under section 104(b)(4) of this title are in excess of the needs
      of the State for resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitating
      Interstate System routes and the State is adequately maintaining
      the Interstate System and the Secretary accepts such
      certification, the State may transfer such excess part to its
      apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(3).

      transfer to its apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and
      104(b)(3) of this title - 
          (A) in fiscal year 1987, an amount not to exceed 20 percent
        of the funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(4)
        which are not obligated at the time of the transfer; and
          (B) in any fiscal year thereafter, an amount not to exceed 20
        percent of the funds apportioned to the State under section
        104(b)(4) for such fiscal year.

      (d) Limitation on New Capacity. - Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this title, the portion of the cost of any project
    undertaken pursuant to this section that is attributable to the
    expansion of the capacity of any Interstate highway or bridge,

    that it has such a program and the Interstate system is maintained
    in accordance with that program. If a State fails to certify as
    required or if the Secretary determines a State is not adequately
    maintaining the Interstate system in accordance with such program
    then the next apportionment of funds to such State for the
    Interstate system shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per
    centum of the amount which would otherwise be apportioned to such
    State under section 104 of this title. If, within one year from the
    date the apportionment for a State is reduced under this
    subsection, the Secretary determines that such State is maintaining
    the Interstate system in accordance with the guidelines the
    apportionment of such State shall be increased by an amount equal

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 120. Federal share payable

-STATUTE-
      (a) Interstate System Projects. - 
        (1) In general. - Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
      the Federal share payable on account of any project on the
      Interstate System (including a project to add high occupancy
      vehicle lanes and a project to add auxiliary lanes but excluding
      a project to add any other lanes) shall be 90 percent of the
      total cost thereof, plus a percentage of the remaining 10 percent
      of such cost in any State containing unappropriated and
      unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands, individual
      and tribal, exceeding 5 percent of the total area of all lands
      therein, equal to the percentage that the area of such lands in
      such State is of its total area; except that such Federal share
      payable on any project in any State shall not exceed 95 percent
      of the total cost of such project.
        (2) State-determined lower federal share. - In the case of any
      project subject to paragraph (1), a State may determine a lower
      Federal share than the Federal share determined under such
      paragraph.

      (b) Other Projects. - Except as otherwise provided in this title,
    the Federal share payable on account of any project or activity
    carried out under this title (other than a project subject to
    subsection (a)) shall be - 
        (1) 80 percent of the cost thereof, except that in the case of
      any State containing nontaxable Indian lands, individual and
      tribal, and public domain lands (both reserved and unreserved)
      exclusive of national forests and national parks and monuments,
      exceeding 5 percent of the total area of all lands therein, the
      Federal share, for purposes of this chapter, shall be increased
      by a percentage of the remaining cost equal to the percentage
      that the area of all such lands in such State, is of its total
      area; or
        (2) 80 percent of the cost thereof, except that in the case of
      any State containing nontaxable Indian lands, individual and
      tribal, public domain lands (both reserved and unreserved),
      national forests, and national parks and monuments, the Federal
      share, for purposes of this chapter, shall be increased by a
      percentage of the remaining cost equal to the percentage that the
      area of all such lands in such State is of its total area;

    except that the Federal share payable on any project in a State
    shall not exceed 95 percent of the total cost of any such project.
    In any case where a State elects to have the Federal share provided
    in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the State must enter into an
    agreement with the Secretary covering a period of not less than 1
    year, requiring such State to use solely for purposes eligible for
    assistance under this title (other than paying its share of
    projects approved under this title) during the period covered by
    such agreement the difference between the State's share as provided
    in paragraph (2) and what its share would be if it elected to pay
    the share provided in paragraph (1) for all projects subject to
    such agreement. In the case of any project subject to this
    subsection, a State may determine a lower Federal share than the
    Federal share determined under the preceding sentences of this
    subsection.
      (c) Increased Federal Share. - 
        (1) Certain safety projects. - The Federal share payable on
      account of any project for traffic control signalization, traffic
      circles (also known as "roundabouts"), safety rest areas,
      pavement marking, commuter carpooling and vanpooling, rail-
      highway crossing closure, or installation of traffic signs,
      traffic lights, guardrails, impact attenuators, concrete barrier
      endtreatments, breakaway utility poles, or priority control
      systems for emergency vehicles or transit vehicles at signalized
      intersections may amount to 100 percent of the cost of
      construction of such projects; except that not more than 10
      percent of all sums apportioned for all the Federal-aid systems
      for any fiscal year in accordance with section 104 of this title
      shall be used under this subsection. In this subsection, the term
      "safety rest area" means an area where motor vehicle operators
      can park their vehicles and rest, where food, fuel, and lodging
      services are not available, and that is located on a segment of
      highway with respect to which the Secretary determines there is a
      shortage of public and private areas at which motor vehicle
      operators can park their vehicles and rest.
        (2) CMAQ projects. - The Federal share payable on account of a
      project or program carried out under section 149 with funds
      obligated in fiscal year 2008 or 2009, or both, shall be not less
      than 80 percent and, at the discretion of the State, may be up to
      100 percent of the cost thereof.

      (d) The Secretary may rely on a statement from the Secretary of
    the Interior as to the area of the lands referred to in subsections
    (a) and (b) of this section. The Secretary of the Interior is
    authorized and directed to provide such statement annually.
      (e) Emergency Relief. - The Federal share payable on account of
    any repair or reconstruction provided for by funds made available
    under section 125 of this title on account of any project on a
    Federal-aid highway, including the Interstate System, shall not
    exceed the Federal share payable on a project on such highway as
    provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section; except that
    (1) the Federal share payable for eligible emergency repairs to
    minimize damage, protect facilities, or restore essential traffic
    accomplished within 180 days after the actual occurrence of the
    natural disaster or catastrophic failure may amount to 100 percent
    of the costs thereof; and (2) the Federal share payable on account
    of any repair or reconstruction of forest highways, forest
    development roads and trails, park roads and trails, parkways,
    public lands highways, public lands development roads and trails,
    and Indian reservation roads may amount to 100 percent of the cost
    thereof. The total cost of a project may not exceed the cost of
    repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility. As used in this
    section with respect to bridges and in section 144 of this title,
    "a comparable facility" shall mean a facility which meets the
    current geometric and construction standards required for the types
    and volume of traffic which such facility will carry over its
    design life.
      (f) The Secretary is authorized to cooperate with the State
    transportation departments and with the Department of the Interior
    in the construction of Federal-aid highways within Indian
    reservations and national parks and monuments under the
    jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and to pay the
    amount assumed therefor from the funds apportioned in accordance
    with section 104 of this title to the State wherein the
    reservations and national parks and monuments are located.
      (g) At the request of any State, the Secretary may from time to
    time enter into agreements with such State to reimburse the State
    for the Federal share of the costs of preliminary and construction
    engineering at an agreed percentage of actual construction costs
    for each project, in lieu of the actual engineering costs for such
    project. The Secretary shall annually review each such agreement to
    insure that such percentage reasonably represents the engineering
    costs actually incurred by such State.
      (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of
    this title, the Federal share payable on account of any project
    under this title in the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or
    the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be 100 per
    centum of the total cost of the project.
      (i) Increased Non-Federal Share. - Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this title and subject to such criteria as the
    Secretary may establish, a State may contribute an amount in excess
    of the non-Federal share of a project under this title so as to
    decrease the Federal share payable on such project.
      (j) Credit for Non-Federal Share. - 
        (1) Eligibility. - 
          (A) In general. - A State may use as a credit toward the non-
        Federal share requirement for any funds made available to
        carry out this title (other than the emergency relief program
        authorized by section 125 and the Appalachian development
        highway system program under section 14501 of title 40) or
        chapter 53 of title 49 toll revenues that are generated and
        used by public, quasi-public, and private agencies to build,
        improve, or maintain highways, bridges, or tunnels that serve
        the public purpose of interstate commerce.
          (B) Special rule for use of federal funds. - If the public,
        quasi-public, or private agency has built, improved, or
        maintained the facility using Federal funds, the credit under
        this paragraph shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the
        percentage of the total cost of building, improving, or
        maintaining the facility that was derived from Federal funds.
          (C) Federal funds defined. - In this paragraph, the term
        "Federal funds" does not include loans of Federal funds or
        other financial assistance that must be repaid to the
        Government.

        (2) Maintenance of effort. - 
          (A) In general. - The credit for any non-Federal share
        provided under this subsection shall not reduce nor replace
        State funds required to match Federal funds for any program
        under this title.
          (B) Condition on receipt of credit. - To receive a credit
        under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, a State shall enter into
        such agreement as the Secretary may require to ensure that the
        State will maintain its non-Federal transportation capital
        expenditures in such fiscal year at or above the average level
        of such expenditures for the preceding 3 fiscal years; except
        that if, for any 1 of the preceding 3 fiscal years, the non-
        Federal transportation capital expenditures of the State were
        at a level that was greater than 130 percent of the average
        level of such expenditures for the other 2 of the preceding 3
        fiscal years, the agreement shall ensure that the State will
        maintain its non-Federal transportation capital expenditures in
        the fiscal year of the credit at or above the average level of
        such expenditures for the other 2 fiscal years.
          (C) Transportation capital expenditures defined. - In
        subparagraph (B), the term "non-Federal transportation capital
        expenditures" includes any payments made by the State for
        issuance of transportation-related bonds.

        (3) Treatment. - 
          (A) Limitation on liability. - Use of a credit for a non-
        Federal share under this subsection that is received from a
        public, quasi-public, or private agency - 
            (i) shall not expose the agency to additional liability,
          additional regulation, or additional administrative
          oversight; and
            (ii) shall not subject the agency to any additional Federal
          design standards or laws (including regulations) as a result
          of providing the non-Federal share other than those to which
          the agency is already subject.

          (B) Chartered multistate agencies. - When a credit that is
        received from a chartered multistate agency is applied to a non-
        Federal share under this subsection, such credit shall be
        applied equally to all charter States.

      (k) Use of Federal Land Management Agency Funds. -
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the funds appropriated
    to any Federal land management agency may be used to pay the non-
    Federal share of the cost of any project the Federal share of
    which is funded under this title or chapter 53 of title 49.
      (l) Use of Federal Lands Highways Program Funds. -
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the funds authorized to
    be appropriated to carry out the Federal lands highways program

      "(a) Eligibility. - A State may use as a credit toward the non-

    [see Short Title of 1991 Amendment note set out under section 101
    of Title 49, Transportation] and title 23, United States Code, toll

    from funds apportioned to the State under title 23, United States
    Code, in each of the fiscal years 1995 and 1996, a pro rata share
    of each category of apportioned funds. The amount which shall be
    deducted in each fiscal year shall be equal to 50 percent of the
    amount needed for repayment. Any amount deducted under this
    subsection shall be reapportioned for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 in

    (b).
      "(d) Qualifying Project Defined. - For purposes of this section,
    the term 'qualifying project' means a project approved by the
    Secretary after the effective date of this title [Dec. 18, 1991],
    or a project for which the United States becomes obligated to pay
    after such effective date, and for which the Governor of the State

      Section 115(c) of Pub. L. 95-599 provided that: "No interest
    shall be paid under authority of section 122 of title 23, United

    issued in any fiscal year by a State after the date of enactment of
    this Act may be paid under authority of section 122 of title 23,

    Sec. 123. Relocation of utility facilities

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a State shall pay for the cost of relocation of utility
    facilities necessitated by the construction of a project on any
    Federal-aid system, Federal funds may be used to reimburse the
    State for such cost in the same proportion as Federal funds are
    expended on the project. Federal funds shall not be used to
    reimburse the State under this section when the payment to the
    utility violates the law of the State or violates a legal contract
    between the utility and the State. Such reimbursement shall be made
    only after evidence satisfactory to the Secretary shall have been
    presented to him substantiating the fact that the State has paid
    such cost from its own funds with respect to Federal-aid highway
    projects for which Federal funds are obligated subsequent to April
    16, 1958, for work, including relocation of utility facilities.
      (b) The term "utility", for the purposes of this section, shall
    include publicly, privately, and cooperatively owned utilities.
      (c) The term "cost of relocation", for the purposes of this
    section, shall include the entire amount paid by such utility
    properly attributable to such relocation after deducting therefrom
    any increase in the value of the new facility and any salvage value
    derived from the old facility.

    201, provided that:
      "(1) Study. - The Comptroller General shall conduct a study to
    assess the impact that a utility company's failure to relocate its
    facilities in a timely manner has on the delivery and cost of
    Federal-aid highway and bridge projects. The study shall also
    assess the following:
        "(A) Methods States use to mitigate such delays, including the
      use of the courts to compel cooperation.
        "(B) The prevalence and use of incentives to utility companies
      for early completion of utility relocations on Federal-aid
      transportation project sites and, conversely, penalties assessed
      on utility companies for utility relocation delays on such
      projects.
        "(C) The extent to which States have used available
      technologies, such as subsurface utility engineering, early in
      the design of Federal-aid highway and bridge projects so as to
      eliminate or reduce the need for or delays due to utility
      relocations.
        "(D) Whether individual States compensate transportation
      contractors for business costs incurred by the contractors when
      Federal-aid highway and bridge projects under contract to them
      are delayed by utility-company-caused delays in utility
      relocations and any methods used by States in making any such
      compensation.
      "(2) Report. - Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
    of this Act [June 9, 1998], the Comptroller General shall transmit
    to Congress a report on the results of the study with any
    recommendations the Comptroller General determines appropriate as a
    result of the study."

    Sec. 124. Advances to States

-STATUTE-
      If the Secretary shall determine that it is necessary for the
    expeditious completion of projects on any of the Federal-aid
    systems, including the Interstate System, he may advance to any
    State out of any existing appropriations the Federal share of the
    cost of construction thereof to enable the State transportation
    department to make prompt payments for acquisition of rights-of-
    way, and for the construction as it progresses. The sums so
    advanced shall be deposited in a special revolving trust fund, by
    the State official authorized under the laws of the State to
    receive Federal-aid highway funds, to be disbursed solely upon
    vouchers approved by the State transportation department for rights-
    of-way which have been or are being acquired, and for construction
    which has been actually performed and approved by the Secretary
    pursuant to this chapter. Upon determination by the Secretary that
    any part of the funds advanced to any State under the provisions of
    this section are no longer required, the amount of the advance,
    which is determined to be in excess of current requirements of the
    State, shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall
    be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds
    were advanced. Any sum advanced and not repaid on demand shall be
    deducted from sums due the State for the Federal pro rata share of
    the cost of construction of Federal-aid projects.

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Eligibility. - Subject to this section and section
    120, an emergency fund is authorized for expenditure by the
    Secretary for the repair or reconstruction of highways, roads, and
    trails, in any part of the United States, including Indian
    reservations, that the Secretary finds have suffered serious damage
    as a result of -

      (c) Funding. - Subject to the following limitations, there are
    authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund (other

      out the provisions of this section; except that, if in any fiscal
      year the total of all obligations under this section is less than
      the amount authorized to be obligated in such fiscal year, the
      unobligated balance of such amount shall remain available until
      expended and shall be in addition to amounts otherwise available
      to carry out this section each year.
        (2) Pending such appropriation or replenishment, the Secretary
      may obligate from any funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated
      for obligation in accordance with this title, including existing
      Federal-aid appropriations, such sums as may be necessary for the

    from the emergency fund herein authorized on Federal-aid highways.
    Except as to highways, roads, and trails mentioned in subsection
    (e) of this section, no funds shall be so expended unless the
    Secretary has received an application therefor from the State
    transportation department, and unless an emergency has been
    declared by the Governor of the State and concurred in by the
    Secretary, except that if the President has declared such emergency
    to be a major disaster for the purposes of the Robert T. Stafford
    Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et
    seq.) concurrence of the Secretary is not required.
      (e) The Secretary may expend funds from the emergency fund herein
    authorized, either independently or in cooperation with any other

-HEAD-
    Sec. 129. Toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and ferries

-STATUTE-
      (a) Basic Program. - 
        (1) Authorization for federal participation. - Notwithstanding
      section 301 of this title and subject to the provisions of this
      section, the Secretary shall permit Federal participation in - 
          (A) initial construction of a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel
        (other than a highway, bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate
        System) or approach thereto;
          (B) reconstructing, resurfacing, restoring, and
        rehabilitating a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel (including a
        toll highway, bridge, or tunnel subject to an agreement entered
        into under this section or section 119(e) as in effect on the
        day before the date of the enactment of the Intermodal Surface
        Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991) or approach thereto;
          (C) reconstruction or replacement of a toll-free bridge or
        tunnel and conversion of the bridge or tunnel to a toll
        facility;
          (D) reconstruction of a toll-free Federal-aid highway (other
        than a highway on the Interstate System) and conversion of the
        highway to a toll facility; and
          (E) preliminary studies to determine the feasibility of a
        toll facility for which Federal participation is authorized
        under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D);

      on the same basis and in the same manner as in the construction
      of free highways under this chapter.
        (2) Ownership. - Each highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach
      thereto constructed under this subsection must - 
          (A) be publicly owned, or
          (B) be privately owned if the public authority having
        jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach has
        entered into a contract with a private person or persons to
        design, finance, construct, and operate the facility and the
        public authority will be responsible for complying with all
        applicable requirements of this title with respect to the
        facility.

        (3) Limitations on use of revenues. - Before the Secretary may
      permit Federal participation under this subsection in
      construction of a highway, bridge, or tunnel located in a State,
      the public authority (including the State transportation
      department) having jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, or
      tunnel must enter into an agreement with the Secretary which
      provides that all toll revenues received from operation of the
      toll facility will be used first for debt service, for reasonable
      return on investment of any private person financing the project,
      and for the costs necessary for the proper operation and
      maintenance of the toll facility, including reconstruction,
      resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. If the State
      certifies annually that the tolled facility is being adequately
      maintained, the State may use any toll revenues in excess of
      amounts required under the preceding sentence for any purpose for
      which Federal funds may be obligated by a State under this title.
        (4) Special rule for funding. - In the case of a toll highway,
      bridge, or tunnel under the jurisdiction of a public authority of
      a State (other than the State transportation department), upon
      request of the State transportation department and subject to
      such terms and conditions as such department and public authority
      may agree, the Secretary shall reimburse such public authority
      for the Federal share of the costs of construction of the project
      carried out on the toll facility under this subsection in the
      same manner and to the same extent as such department would be
      reimbursed if such project was being carried out by such
      department. The reimbursement of funds under this paragraph shall
      be from sums apportioned to the State under this chapter and
      available for obligations on projects on the Federal-aid system
      in such State on which the project is being carried out.
        (5) Limitation on federal share. - The Federal share payable
      for a project described in paragraph (1) shall be a percentage
      determined by the State but not to exceed 80 percent.
        (6) Modifications. - If a public authority (including a State
      transportation department) having jurisdiction over a toll
      highway, bridge, or tunnel subject to an agreement under this
      section or section 119(e), as in effect on the day before the
      effective date of title I of the Intermodal Surface
      Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, requests modification of
      such agreement, the Secretary shall modify such agreement to
      allow the continuation of tolls in accordance with paragraph (3)
      without repayment of Federal funds.
        (7) Loans. - 
          (A) In general. - A State may loan to a public or private
        entity constructing or proposing to construct under this
        section a toll facility or non-toll facility with a dedicated
        revenue source an amount equal to all or part of the Federal
        share of the cost of the project if the project has a revenue
        source specifically dedicated to it. Dedicated revenue sources
        for non-toll facilities include excise taxes, sales taxes,
        motor vehicle use fees, tax on real property, tax increment
        financing, and such other dedicated revenue sources as the
        Secretary determines appropriate.
          (B) Compliance with federal laws. - As a condition of
        receiving a loan under this paragraph, the public or private
        entity that receives the loan shall ensure that the project
        will be carried out in accordance with this title and any other
        applicable Federal law, including any applicable provision of a
        Federal environmental law.
          (C) Subordination of debt. - The amount of any loan received
        for a project under this paragraph may be subordinated to any
        other debt financing for the project.
          (D) Obligation of funds loaned. - Funds loaned under this
        paragraph may only be obligated for projects under this
        paragraph.
          (E) Repayment. - The repayment of a loan made under this
        paragraph shall commence not later than 5 years after date on
        which the facility that is the subject of the loan is open to
        traffic.
          (F) Term of loan. - The term of a loan made under this
        paragraph shall not exceed 30 years from the date on which the
        loan funds are obligated.
          (G) Interest. - A loan made under this paragraph shall bear
        interest at or below market interest rates, as determined by
        the State, to make the project that is the subject of the loan
        feasible.
          (H) Reuse of funds. - Amounts repaid to a State from a loan
        made under this paragraph may be obligated - 
            (i) for any purpose for which the loan funds were available
          under this title; and
            (ii) for the purchase of insurance or for use as a capital
          reserve for other forms of credit enhancement for project
          debt in order to improve credit market access or to lower
          interest rates for projects eligible for assistance under
          this title.

          (I) Guidelines. - The Secretary shall establish procedures
        and guidelines for making loans under this paragraph.

        (8) Initial construction defined. - For purposes of this
      subsection, the term "initial construction" means the
      construction of a highway, bridge, or tunnel at any time before
      it is open to traffic and does not include any improvement to a
      highway, bridge, or tunnel after it is open to traffic.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 301 of this title,
    the Secretary may permit Federal participation under this title in
    the construction of a project constituting an approach to a ferry,
    whether toll or free, the route of which is a public road and has
    not been designated as a route on the Interstate System. Such ferry
    may be either publicly or privately owned and operated, but the
    operating authority and the amount of fares charged for passage
    shall be under the control of a State agency or official, and all
    revenues derived from publicly owned or operated ferries shall be
    applied to payment of the cost of construction or acquisition
    thereof, including debt service, and to actual and necessary costs
    of operation, maintenance, repair, and replacement.
      (c) Notwithstanding section 301 of this title, the Secretary may
    permit Federal participation under this title in the construction
    of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities, whether toll or free,
    subject to the following conditions:
        (1) It is not feasible to build a bridge, tunnel, combination
      thereof, or other normal highway structure in lieu of the use of
      such ferry.
        (2) The operation of the ferry shall be on a route classified
      as a public road within the State and which has not been
      designated as a route on the Interstate System. Projects under
      this subsection may be eligible for both ferry boats carrying
      cars and passengers and ferry boats carrying passengers only.
        (3) Such ferry boat or ferry terminal facility shall be
      publicly owned or operated or majority publicly owned if the
      Secretary determines with respect to a majority publicly owned
      ferry or ferry terminal facility that such ferry boat or ferry
      terminal facility provides substantial public benefits.
        (4) The operating authority and the amount of fares charged for
      passage on such ferry shall be under the control of the State or
      other public entity, and all revenues derived therefrom shall be
      applied to actual and necessary costs of operation, maintenance,
      and (!1) repair, debt service, negotiated management fees, and,
      in the case of a privately operated toll ferry, for a reasonable
      rate of return.

        (5) Such ferry may be operated only within the State (including
      the islands which comprise the State of Hawaii and the islands
      which comprise any territory of the United States) or between
      adjoining States or between a point in a State and a point in the
      Dominion of Canada. Except with respect to operations between the
      islands which comprise the State of Hawaii, operations between
      the islands which comprise any territory of the United States,
      operations between a point in a State and a point in the Dominion
      of Canada, and operations between any two points in Alaska and
      between Alaska and Washington, including stops at appropriate
      points in the Dominion of Canada, no part of such ferry operation
      shall be in any foreign or international waters.
        (6) No such ferry shall be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed
      of without the approval of the Secretary. The Federal share of
      any proceeds from such a disposition shall be credited to the
      unprogramed balance of Federal-aid highway funds of the same
      class last apportioned to such State. Any amount so credited
      shall be in addition to all other funds then apportioned to such
      State and available for expenditure in accordance with the
      provisions of this title.

    highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto or conversion of a
    highway, bridge, or tunnel to a toll facility under this subsection

    reconstruction and improvement of two-lane toll road designated as
    part of the Interstate System before June 30, 1973, as necessary to
    bring such road to standards of Interstate System, provided that
    toll road authority agreed that no new indebtedness to be
    liquidated by tolls was to be incurred, that all tolls be used for

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 130. Railway-highway crossings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Subject to section 120 and subsection (b) of this section,
    the entire cost of construction of projects for the elimination of
    hazards of railway-highway crossings, including the separation or
    protection of grades at crossings, the reconstruction of existing
    railroad grade crossing structures, and the relocation of highways
    to eliminate grade crossings, may be paid from sums apportioned in
    accordance with section 104 of this title. In any case when the
    elimination of the hazards of a railway-highway crossing can be
    effected by the relocation of a portion of a railway at a cost
    estimated by the Secretary to be less than the cost of such
    elimination by one of the methods mentioned in the first sentence
    of this section, then the entire cost of such relocation project,
    subject to section 120 and subsection (b) of this section, may be
    paid from sums apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this
    title.
      (b) The Secretary may classify the various types of projects
    involved in the elimination of hazards of railway-highway
    crossings, and may set for each such classification a percentage of
    the costs of construction which shall be deemed to represent the
    net benefit to the railroad or railroads for the purpose of
    determining the railroad's share of the cost of construction. The
    percentage so determined shall in no case exceed 10 per centum. The
    Secretary shall determine the appropriate classification of each
    project.
      (c) Any railroad involved in a project for the elimination of
    hazards of railway-highway crossings paid for in whole or in part
    from sums made available for expenditure under this title, or prior
    Acts, shall be liable to the United States for the net benefit to
    the railroad determined under the classification of such project
    made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Such liability to
    the United States may be discharged by direct payment to the State
    transportation department of the State in which the project is
    located, in which case such payment shall be credited to the cost
    of the project. Such payment may consist in whole or in part of
    materials and labor furnished by the railroad in connection with
    the construction of such project. If any such railroad fails to
    discharge such liability within a six-month period after completion
    of the project, it shall be liable to the United States for its
    share of the cost, and the Secretary shall request the Attorney
    General to institute proceedings against such railroad for the
    recovery of the amount for which it is liable under this
    subsection. The Attorney General is authorized to bring such
    proceedings on behalf of the United States, in the appropriate
    district court of the United States, and the United States shall be
    entitled in such proceedings to recover such sums as it is
    considered and adjudged by the court that such railroad is liable
    for in the premises. Any amounts recovered by the United States
    under this subsection shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.
      (d) Survey and Schedule of Projects. - Each State shall conduct
    and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify
    those railroad crossings which may require separation, relocation,
    or protective devices, and establish and implement a schedule of
    projects for this purpose. At a minimum, such a schedule shall
    provide signs for all railway-highway crossings.
      (e) Funds for Protective Devices. - 
        (1) In general. - Before making an apportionment under section
      104(b)(5) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall set aside, from
      amounts made available to carry out the highway safety
      improvement program under section 148 for such fiscal year, at
      least $220,000,000 for the elimination of hazards and the
      installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings.
      At least  1/2  of the funds authorized for and expended under
      this section shall be available for the installation of
      protective devices at railway-highway crossings. Sums authorized
      to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be available
      for obligation in the same manner as funds apportioned under
      section 104(b)(1) of this title.
        (2) Special rule. - If a State demonstrates to the satisfaction
      of the Secretary that the State has met all its needs for
      installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings,
      the State may use funds made available by this section for other
      highway safety improvement program purposes.

      (f) Apportionment. - 
        (1) Formula. - Fifty percent of the funds set aside to carry
      out this section pursuant to subsection (e)(1) shall be
      apportioned to the States in accordance with the formula set
      forth in section 104(b)(3)(A), and 50 percent of such funds shall
      be apportioned to the States in the ratio that total public
      railway-highway crossings in each State bears to the total of
      such crossings in all States.
        (2) Minimum apportionment. - Notwithstanding paragraph (1),
      each State shall receive a minimum of one-half of 1 percent of
      the funds apportioned under paragraph (1).
        (3) Federal share. - The Federal share payable on account of
      any project financed with funds set aside to carry out this
      section shall be 90 percent of the cost thereof.

      (g) Annual Report. - Each State shall report to the Secretary not
    later than December 30 of each year on the progress being made to
    implement the railway-highway crossings program authorized by this
    section and the effectiveness of such improvements. Each State
    report shall contain an assessment of the costs of the various
    treatments employed and subsequent accident experience at improved
    locations. The Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on
    Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Commerce,
    Science, and Transportation,(!1) of the Senate and the Committee on
    Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives,
    not later than April 1, 2006, and every 2 years thereafter,,(!1) on
    the progress being made by the State in implementing projects to
    improve railway-highway crossings. The report shall include, but
    not be limited to, the number of projects undertaken, their
    distribution by cost range, road system, nature of treatment, and
    subsequent accident experience at improved locations. In addition,
    the Secretary's report shall analyze and evaluate each State
    program, identify any State found not to be in compliance with the
    schedule of improvements required by subsection (d) and include
    recommendations for future implementation of the railroad highway
    (!2) crossings program.


      (h) Use of Funds for Matching. - Funds authorized to be
    appropriated to carry out this section may be used to provide a
    local government with funds to be used on a matching basis when
    State funds are available which may only be spent when the local
    government produces matching funds for the improvement of railway-
    highway crossings.
      (i) Incentive Payments for At-Grade Crossing Closures. - 
        (1) In general. - Notwithstanding any other provision of this
      section and subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a State may, from
      sums available to the State under this section, make incentive
      payments to local governments in the State upon the permanent
      closure by such governments of public at-grade railway-highway
      crossings under the jurisdiction of such governments.
        (2) Incentive payments by railroads. - A State may not make an
      incentive payment under paragraph (1) to a local government with
      respect to the closure of a crossing unless the railroad owning
      the tracks on which the crossing is located makes an incentive
      payment to the government with respect to the closure.
        (3) Amount of state payment. - The amount of the incentive
      payment payable to a local government by a State under paragraph
      (1) with respect to a crossing may not exceed the lesser of - 
          (A) the amount of the incentive payment paid to the
        government with respect to the crossing by the railroad
        concerned under paragraph (2); or
          (B) $7,500.

        (4) Use of state payments. - A local government receiving an
      incentive payment from a State under paragraph (1) shall use the
      amount of the incentive payment for transportation safety
      improvements.

      (j) Bicycle Safety. - In carrying out projects under this
    section, a State shall take into account bicycle safety.
      (k) Expenditure of Funds. - Not more than 2 percent of funds
    apportioned to a State to carry out this section may be used by the
    State for compilation and analysis of data in support of activities
    carried out under subsection (g).
      (l) National Crossing Inventory. - 
        (1) Initial reporting of crossing information. - Not later than
      1 year after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement
      Act of 2008 or within 6 months of a new crossing becoming
      operational, whichever occurs later, each State shall report to
      the Secretary of Transportation current information, including
      information about warning devices and signage, as specified by
      the Secretary, concerning each previously unreported public
      crossing located within its borders.

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 131. Control of outdoor advertising

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that the erection and
    maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in
    areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the primary system
    should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in
    such highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of
    public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.
      (b) Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1,
    1968, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made
    provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance
    along the Interstate System and the primary system of outdoor
    advertising signs, displays, and devices which are within six
    hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and
    visible from the main traveled way of the system, and Federal-aid
    highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1975, or after the
    expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature,
    whichever is later, to any State which the Secretary determines has
    not made provision for effective control of the erection and
    maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of
    those additional outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices
    which are more than six hundred and sixty feet off the nearest edge
    of the right-of-way, located outside of urban areas, visible from
    the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose
    of their message being read from such main traveled way, shall be
    reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amounts which
    would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of
    this title, until such time as such State shall provide for such
    effective control. Any amount which is withheld from apportionment
    to any State hereunder shall be reapportioned to the other States.
    Whenever he determines it to be in the public interest, the
    Secretary may suspend, for such periods as he deems necessary, the
    application of this subsection to a State.
      (c) Effective control means that such signs, displays, or devices
    after January 1, 1968, if located within six hundred and sixty feet
    of the right-of-way and, on or after July 1, 1975, or after the
    expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature,
    whichever is later, if located beyond six hundred and sixty feet of
    the right-of-way located outside of urban areas, visible from the
    main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of
    their message being read from such main traveled way, shall,
    pursuant to this section, be limited to (1) directional and
    official signs and notices, which signs and notices shall include,
    but not be limited to, signs and notices pertaining to natural
    wonders, scenic and historical attractions, which are required or
    authorized by law, which shall conform to national standards hereby
    authorized to be promulgated by the Secretary hereunder, which
    standards shall contain provisions concerning lighting, size,
    number, and spacing of signs, and such other requirements as may be
    appropriate to implement this section, (2) signs, displays, and
    devices advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they
    are located, (3) signs, displays, and devices, including those
    which may be changed at reasonable intervals by electronic process
    or by remote control, advertising activities conducted on the
    property on which they are located, (4) signs lawfully in existence
    on October 22, 1965, determined by the State, subject to the
    approval of the Secretary, to be landmark signs, including signs on
    farm structures or natural surfaces, or historic or artistic
    significance the preservation of which would be consistent with the
    purposes of this section, and (5) signs, displays, and devices
    advertising the distribution by nonprofit organizations of free
    coffee to individuals traveling on the Interstate System or the
    primary system. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "free
    coffee" shall include coffee for which a donation may be made, but
    is not required.
      (d) In order to promote the reasonable, orderly and effective
    display of outdoor advertising while remaining consistent with the
    purposes of this section, signs, displays, and devices whose size,
    lighting and spacing, consistent with customary use is to be
    determined by agreement between the several States and the
    Secretary, may be erected and maintained within six hundred and
    sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way within areas
    adjacent to the Interstate and primary systems which are zoned
    industrial or commercial under authority of State law, or in
    unzoned commercial or industrial areas as may be determined by
    agreement between the several States and the Secretary. The States
    shall have full authority under their own zoning laws to zone areas
    for commercial or industrial purposes, and the actions of the
    States in this regard will be accepted for the purposes of this
    Act. Whenever a bona fide State, county, or local zoning authority
    has made a determination of customary use, such determination will
    be accepted in lieu of controls by agreement in the zoned
    commercial and industrial areas within the geographical
    jurisdiction of such authority. Nothing in this subsection shall
    apply to signs, displays, and devices referred to in clauses (2)
    and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.
      (e) Any sign, display, or device lawfully in existence along the
    Interstate System or the Federal-aid primary system on September 1,
    1965, which does not conform to this section shall not be required
    to be removed until July 1, 1970. Any other sign, display, or
    device lawfully erected which does not conform to this section
    shall not be required to be removed until the end of the fifth year
    after it becomes nonconforming.
      (f) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the States, provide
    within the rights-of-way for areas at appropriate distances from
    interchanges on the Interstate System, on which signs, displays,
    and devices giving specific information in the interest of the
    traveling public may be erected and maintained. The Secretary may
    also, in consultation with the States, provide within the rights-of-
    way of the primary system for areas in which signs, displays, and
    devices giving specific information in the interest of the
    traveling public may be erected and maintained. Such signs shall
    conform to national standards to be promulgated by the Secretary.
      (g) Just compensation shall be paid upon the removal of any
    outdoor advertising sign, display, or device lawfully erected under
    State law and not permitted under subsection (c) of this section,
    whether or not removed pursuant to or because of this section. The
    Federal share of such compensation shall be 75 per centum. Such
    compensation shall be paid for the following:
        (A) The taking from the owner of such sign, display, or device
      of all right, title, leasehold, and interest in such sign,
      display, or device; and
        (B) The taking from the owner of the real property on which the
      sign, display, or device is located, of the right to erect and
      maintain such signs, displays, and devices thereon.

      (h) All public lands or reservations of the United States which
    are adjacent to any portion of the Interstate System and the
    primary system shall be controlled in accordance with the
    provisions of this section and the national standards promulgated
    by the Secretary.
      (i) In order to provide information in the specific interest of
    the traveling public, the State transportation departments are
    authorized to maintain maps and to permit information directories
    and advertising pamphlets to be made available at safety rest
    areas. Subject to the approval of the Secretary, a State may also
    establish information centers at safety rest areas and other travel
    information systems within the rights-of-way for the purpose of
    informing the public of places of interest within the State and
    providing such other information as a State may consider desirable.
    The Federal share of the cost of establishing such an information
    center or travel information system shall be that which is provided
    in section 120 for a highway project on that Federal-aid system to
    be served by such center or system.
      (j) Any State transportation department which has, under this
    section as in effect on June 30, 1965, entered into an agreement
    with the Secretary to control the erection and maintenance of
    outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent
    to the Interstate System shall be entitled to receive the bonus
    payments as set forth in the agreement, but no such State
    transportation department shall be entitled to such payments unless
    the State maintains the control required under such agreement:
    Provided, That permission by a State to erect and maintain
    information displays which may be changed at reasonable intervals
    by electronic process or remote control and which provide public
    service information or advertise activities conducted on the
    property on which they are located shall not be considered a breach
    of such agreement or the control required thereunder. Such payments
    shall be paid only from appropriations made to carry out this
    section. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed
    to exempt any State from controlling outdoor advertising as
    otherwise provided in this section.
      (k) Subject to compliance with subsection (g) of this section for
    the payment of just compensation, nothing in this section shall
    prohibit a State from establishing standards imposing stricter
    limitations with respect to signs, displays, and devices on the
    Federal-aid highway systems than those established under this
    section.
      (l) Not less than sixty days before making a final determination
    to withhold funds from a State under subsection (b) of this
    section, or to do so under subsection (b) of section 136, or with
    respect to failing to agree as to the size, lighting, and spacing
    of signs, displays, and devices or as to unzoned commercial or
    industrial areas in which signs, displays, and devices may be
    erected and maintained under subsection (d) of this section, or
    with respect to failure to approve under subsection (g) of section
    136, the Secretary shall give written notice to the State of his
    proposed determination and a statement of the reasons therefor, and
    during such period shall give the State an opportunity for a
    hearing on such determination. Following such hearing the Secretary
    shall issue a written order setting forth his final determination
    and shall furnish a copy of such order to the State. Within forty-
    five days of receipt of such order, the State may appeal such
    order to any United States district court for such State, and upon
    the filing of such appeal such order shall be stayed until final
    judgment has been entered on such appeal. Summons may be served at
    any place in the United States. The court shall have jurisdiction
    to affirm the determination of the Secretary or to set it aside, in
    whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to
    review by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in
    which the State is located and to the Supreme Court of the United
    States upon certiorari or certification as provided in title 28,
    United States Code, section 1254. If any part of an apportionment
    to a State is withheld by the Secretary under subsection (b) of
    this section or subsection (b) of section 136, the amount so
    withheld shall not be reapportioned to the other States as long as
    a suit brought by such State under this subsection is pending. Such
    amount shall remain available for apportionment in accordance with
    the final judgment and this subsection. Funds withheld from
    apportionment and subsequently apportioned or reapportioned under
    this section shall be available for expenditure for three full
    fiscal years after the date of such apportionment or
    reapportionment as the case may be.
      (m) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the
    provisions of this section, out of any money in the Treasury not
    otherwise appropriated, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1966, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1967, not to exceed $2,000,000 for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1970, not to exceed $27,000,000 for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1971, not to exceed $20,500,000 for the fiscal
    year ending June 30, 1972, and not to exceed $50,000,000 for the
    fiscal year ending June 30, 1973. The provisions of this chapter
    relating to the obligation, period of availability and expenditure
    of Federal-aid primary highway funds shall apply to the funds
    authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section after June
    30, 1967. Subject to approval by the Secretary in accordance with
    the program of projects approval process of section 105,(!1) a
    State may use any funds apportioned to it under section 104 of this
    title for removal of any sign, display, or device lawfully erected
    which does not conform to this section.

      (n) No sign, display, or device shall be required to be removed
    under this section if the Federal share of the just compensation to
    be paid upon removal of such sign, display, or device is not
    available to make such payment. Funds apportioned to a State under
    section 104 of this title shall not be treated for purposes of the
    preceding sentence as being available to the State for making such
    a payment except to the extent that the State, in its discretion,
    expends such funds for such a payment.
      (o) The Secretary may approve the request of a State to permit
    retention in specific areas defined by such State of directional
    signs, displays, and devices lawfully erected under State law in
    force at the time of their erection which do not conform to the
    requirements of subsection (c), where such signs, displays, and
    devices are in existence on the date of enactment of this
    subsection and where the State demonstrates that such signs,
    displays, and devices (1) provide directional information about
    goods and services in the interest of the traveling public, and (2)
    are such that removal would work a substantial economic hardship in
    such defined area.
      (p) In the case of any sign, display, or device required to be
    removed under this section prior to the date of enactment of the
    Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1974, which sign, display, or device was
    after its removal lawfully relocated and which as a result of the
    amendments made to this section by such Act is required to be
    removed, the United States shall pay 100 per centum of the just
    compensation for such removal (including all relocation costs).
      (q)(1) During the implementation of State laws enacted to comply
    with this section, the Secretary shall encourage and assist the
    States to develop sign controls and programs which will assure that
    necessary directional information about facilities providing goods
    and services in the interest of the traveling public will continue
    to be available to motorists. To this end the Secretary shall
    restudy and revise as appropriate existing standards for
    directional signs authorized under subsections 131(c)(1) and 131(f)
    to develop signs which are functional and esthetically compatible
    with their surroundings. He shall employ the resources of other
    Federal departments and agencies, including the National Endowment
    for the Arts, and employ maximum participation of private industry
    in the development of standards and systems of signs developed for
    those purposes.
      (2) Among other things the Secretary shall encourage States to
    adopt programs to assure that removal of signs providing necessary
    directional information, which also were providing directional
    information on June 1, 1972, about facilities in the interest of
    the traveling public, be deferred until all other nonconforming
    signs are removed.
      (r) Removal of Illegal Signs. - 
        (1) By owners. - Any sign, display, or device along the
      Interstate System or the Federal-aid primary system which was not
      lawfully erected, shall be removed by the owner of such sign,
      display, or device not later than the 90th day following the
      effective date of this subsection.
        (2) By states. - If any owner does not remove a sign, display,
      or device in accordance with paragraph (1), the State within the
      borders of which the sign, display, or device is located shall
      remove the sign, display, or device. The owner of the removed
      sign, display, or device shall be liable to the State for the
      costs of such removal. Effective control under this section
      includes compliance with the first sentence of this paragraph.

      (s) Scenic Byway Prohibition. - If a State has a scenic byway
    program, the State may not allow the erection along any highway on
    the Interstate System or Federal-aid primary system which before,
    on, or after the effective date of this subsection, is designated
    as a scenic byway under such program of any sign, display, or
    device which is not in conformance with subsection (c) of this
    section. Control of any sign, display, or device on such a highway
    shall be in accordance with this section. In designating a scenic
    byway for purposes of this section and section 1047 of the
    Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, a State
    may exclude from such designation any segment of a highway that is
    inconsistent with the State's criteria for designating State scenic
    byways. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude a State
    from signing any such excluded segment, including such segment on a
    map, or carrying out similar activities, solely for purposes of
    system continuity.
      (t) Primary System Defined. - For purposes of this section, the
    terms "primary system" and "Federal-aid primary system" mean the
    Federal-aid primary system in existence on June 1, 1991, and any
    highway which is not on such system but which is on the National
    Highway System.

    Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and
    since decisions by the Secretary concerning statewide
    transportation plans or the transportation improvement program
    described in this section have not been reviewed under such Act as
    of January 1, 1997, any decision by the Secretary concerning a
    metropolitan or statewide transportation plan or the transportation
    improvement program described in this section shall not be
    considered to be a Federal action subject to review under such Act.

    outdoor junkyards, which are within one thousand feet of the
    nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled
    way of the system, shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per
    centum of the amounts which would otherwise be apportioned to such
    State under section 104 of this title, until such time as such
    State shall provide for such effective control. Any amount which is
    withheld from apportionment to any State hereunder shall be
    reapportioned to the other States. Whenever he determines it to be
    in the public interest, the Secretary may suspend, for such periods
    as he deems necessary, the application of this subsection to a
    State.
      (c) Effective control means that by January 1, 1968, such
    junkyards shall be screened by natural objects, plantings, fences,
    or other appropriate means so as not to be visible from the main
    traveled way of the system, or shall be removed from sight.
      (d) The term "junk" shall mean old or scrap copper, brass, rope,
    rags, batteries, paper, trash, rubber debris, waste, or junked,

      (f) The term "junkyard" shall mean an establishment or place of
    business which is maintained, operated, or used for storing,
    keeping, buying, or selling junk, or for the maintenance or
    operation of an automobile graveyard, and the term shall include
    garbage dumps and sanitary fills.
      (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, junkyards,
    auto graveyards, and scrap metal processing facilities may be
    operated within areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the
    primary system which are within one thousand feet of the nearest
    edge of the right-of-way and which are zoned industrial under
    authority of State law, or which are not zoned under authority of
    State law, but are used for industrial activities, as determined by
    the several States subject to approval by the Secretary.
      (h) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, any junkyard
    in existence on the date of enactment of this section which does
    not conform to the requirements of this section and which the
    Secretary finds as a practical matter cannot be screened, shall not
    be required to be removed until July 1, 1970.
      (i) The Federal share of landscaping and screening costs under
    this section shall be 75 per centum.
      (j) Just compensation shall be paid the owner for the relocation,
    removal, or disposal of junkyards lawfully established under State
    law. The Federal share of such compensation shall be 75 per centum.
      (k) All public lands or reservations of the United States which
    are adjacent to any portion of the interstate and primary systems
    shall be effectively controlled in accordance with the provisions
    of this section.
      (l) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a State from
    establishing standards imposing stricter limitations with respect
    to outdoor junkyards on the Federal-aid highway systems than those
    established under this section.
      (m) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this
    section, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
    appropriated, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending
    June 30, 1966, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending

    outside a central business district, as defined by the Secretary,
    and the construction of publicly owned parking facilities thereon
    or within such right-of-way, including the use of the air space
    above and below the established grade line of the highway pavement,
    to serve an urban area of fifty thousand population or more. Such
    parking facility shall be located and designed in conjunction with
    existing or planned public transportation facilities. In the event
    fees are charged for the use of any such facility, the rate thereof
    shall not be in excess of that required for maintenance and
    operation (including compensation to any person for operating such
    facility).
      (b) The Secretary shall not approve any project under this
    section until - 
        (1) he has determined that the State, or the political
      subdivision thereof, where such project is to be located, or any
      agency or instrumentality of such State or political subdivision,
      has the authority and capability of constructing, maintaining,
      and operating the facility;
        (2) he has entered into an agreement governing the financing,
      maintenance, and operation of the parking facility with such
      State, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality,
      including necessary requirements to insure that adequate public
      transportation services will be available to persons using such
      facility; and
        (3) he has approved design standards for constructing such
      facility developed in cooperation with the State transportation
      department.

      (c) The term "parking facilities" for purposes of this section
    shall include access roads, buildings, structures, equipment,

      (d) Nothing in this section, or in any rule or regulation issued
    under this section, or in any agreement required by this section,

    operate any parking facility constructed under this section, or (2)
    any such person from so operating such facility.
      (e) The Secretary shall not approve any project under this
    section unless he determines that it is based on a continuing
    comprehensive transportation planning process carried on in
    accordance with section 134 of this title.
      (f)(1) The Secretary may approve for Federal financial assistance
    from funds apportioned under section 104(b)(4), projects for
    designating existing facilities, or for acquisition of rights of
    way or construction of new facilities, for use as preferential
    parking for carpools, provided that such facilities (A) are located
    outside of a central business district and within an interstate
    highway corridor, and (B) have as their primary purpose the
    reduction of vehicular traffic on the interstate highway.
      (2) Nothing in this subsection, or in any rule or regulation
    issued under this subsection, or in any agreement required by this
    subsection, shall prohibit (A) any State, political subdivision, or
    agency or instrumentality thereof, from contracting with any person
    to operate any parking facility designated or constructed under
    this subsection, or (B) any such person from so operating such
    facility. Any fees charged for the use of any such facility in
    connection with the purpose of this subsection shall not be in
    excess of the amount required for operation and maintenance,
    including compensation to any person for operating the facility.
      (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the terms "facilities"
    and "parking facilities" are synonymous and shall have the same
    meaning given "parking facilities" in subsection (c) of this
    section.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Declaration of Policy. - It is declared to be the national
    policy that special effort should be made to preserve the natural
    beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands,
    wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites. The Secretary
    of Transportation shall cooperate and consult with the Secretaries
    of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture,
    and with the States in developing transportation plans and programs
    that include measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of
    the lands traversed. After the effective date of the Federal-Aid
    Highway Act of 1968, the Secretary shall not approve any program or
    project (other than any project for a park road or parkway under
    section 204 of this title) which requires the use of any publicly
    owned land from a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and
    waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance as
    determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having
    jurisdiction thereof, or any land from an historic site of
    national, State, or local significance as so determined by such
    officials unless (1) there is no feasible and prudent alternative
    to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible
    planning to minimize harm to such park, recreational area, wildlife
    and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from such use. In
    carrying out the national policy declared in this section the
    Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and
    appropriate State and local officials, is authorized to conduct
    studies as to the most feasible Federal-aid routes for the movement
    of motor vehicular traffic through or around national parks so as
    to best serve the needs of the traveling public while preserving
    the natural beauty of these areas.
      (b) De Minimis Impacts. - 
        (1) Requirements. - 
          (A) Requirements for historic sites. - The requirements of
        this section shall be considered to be satisfied with respect
        to an area described in paragraph (2) if the Secretary
        determines, in accordance with this subsection, that a
        transportation program or project will have a de minimis impact
        on the area.
          (B) Requirements for parks, recreation areas, and wildlife or
        waterfowl refuges. - The requirements of subsection (a)(1)
        shall be considered to be satisfied with respect to an area
        described in paragraph (3) if the Secretary determines, in
        accordance with this subsection, that a transportation program
        or project will have a de minimis impact on the area. The
        requirements of subsection (a)(2) with respect to an area
        described in paragraph (3) shall not include an alternatives
        analysis.
          (C) Criteria. - In making any determination under this
        subsection, the Secretary shall consider to be part of a
        transportation program or project any avoidance, minimization,
        mitigation, or enhancement measures that are required to be
        implemented as a condition of approval of the transportation
        program or project.

        (2) Historic sites. - With respect to historic sites, the
      Secretary may make a finding of de minimis impact only if - 
          (A) the Secretary has determined, in accordance with the
        consultation process required under section 106 of the National
        Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470f), that - 
            (i) the transportation program or project will have no
          adverse effect on the historic site; or
            (ii) there will be no historic properties affected by the
          transportation program or project;

          (B) the finding of the Secretary has received written
        concurrence from the applicable State historic preservation
        officer or tribal historic preservation officer (and from the
        Advisory Council on Historic Preservation if the Council is
        participating in the consultation process); and
          (C) the finding of the Secretary has been developed in
        consultation with parties consulting as part of the process
        referred to in subparagraph (A).

        (3) Parks, recreation areas, and wildlife or waterfowl refuges.
      - With respect to parks, recreation areas, or wildlife or
      waterfowl refuges, the Secretary may make a finding of de minimis
      impact only if - 
          (A) the Secretary has determined, after public notice and
        opportunity for public review and comment, that the
        transportation program or project will not adversely affect the
        activities, features, and attributes of the park, recreation
        area, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge eligible for protection
        under this section; and
          (B) the finding of the Secretary has received concurrence
        from the officials with jurisdiction over the park, recreation
        area, or wildlife or waterfowl refuge.

      limits for environmental review may be approved only if such time
      limits are less than the customary time necessary for such
      review.

      (k) Judicial Review and Savings Clause. - 
        (1) Judicial review. - Except as set forth under subsection
      (l), nothing in this section shall affect the reviewability of
      any final Federal agency action in a court of the United States
      or in the court of any State.
        (2) Savings clause. - Nothing in this section shall be
      construed as superseding, amending, or modifying the National
      Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or any other Federal
      environmental statute or affect the responsibility of any Federal
      officer to comply with or enforce any such statute.
        (3) Limitations. - Nothing in this section shall preempt or
      interfere with - 
          (A) any practice of seeking, considering, or responding to

      unless it is filed within 180 days after publication of a notice
      in the Federal Register announcing that the permit, license, or
      approval is final pursuant to the law under which the agency
      action is taken, unless a shorter time is specified in the
      Federal law pursuant to which judicial review is allowed. Nothing
      in this subsection shall create a right to judicial review or
      place any limit on filing a claim that a person has violated the
      terms of a permit, license, or approval.
        (2) New information. - The Secretary shall consider new

      information satisfies the requirements for a supplemental
      environmental impact statement under section 771.130 of title 23,
      Code of Federal Regulations. The preparation of a supplemental
      environmental impact statement when required shall be considered
      a separate final agency action and the deadline for filing a
      claim for judicial review of such action shall be 180 days after
      the date of publication of a notice in the Federal Register
      announcing such action.

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 140. Nondiscrimination

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prior to approving any programs for projects as provided for
    in section 135, the Secretary shall require assurances from any
    State desiring to avail itself of the benefits of this chapter that
    employment in connection with proposed projects will be provided
    without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, or sex. The
    Secretary shall require that each State shall include in the
    advertised specifications, notification of the specific equal
    employment opportunity responsibilities of the successful bidder.
    In approving programs for projects on any of the Federal-aid
    systems, the Secretary (!1) if necessary to ensure equal employment
    opportunity, shall require certification by any State desiring to
    avail itself of the benefits of this chapter that there are in
    existence and available on a regional, statewide, or local basis,
    apprenticeship, skill improvement or other upgrading programs,
    registered with the Department of Labor or the appropriate State
    agency, if any, which provide equal opportunity for training and
    employment without regard to race, color, creed, national origin,
    or sex. In implementing such programs, a State may reserve training
    positions for persons who receive welfare assistance from such
    State; except that the implementation of any such program shall not
    cause current employees to be displaced or current positions to be
    supplanted or preclude workers that are participating in an
    apprenticeship, skill improvement, or other upgrading program
    registered with the Department of Labor or the appropriate State
    agency from being referred to, or hired on, projects funded under
    this title without regard to the length of time of their
    participation in such program. The Secretary shall periodically
    obtain from the Secretary of Labor and the respective State
    transportation departments information which will enable the
    Secretary to judge compliance with the requirements of this section
    and the Secretary of Labor shall render to the Secretary such
    assistance and information as the Secretary of Transportation shall
    deem necessary to carry out the equal employment opportunity
    program required hereunder.

      (b) The Secretary, in cooperation with any other department or
    agency of the Government, State agency, authority, association,
    institution, Indian tribal government, corporation (profit or
    nonprofit), or any other organization or person, is authorized to
    develop, conduct, and administer surface transportation and
    technology training, including skill improvement programs, and to
    develop and fund summer transportation institutes. Whenever
    apportionments are made under section 104(b)(3) of this title, the
    Secretary shall deduct such sums as necessary, not to exceed
    $10,000,000 per fiscal year, for the administration of this
    subsection. Such sums so deducted shall remain available until
    expended. The provisions of section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41
    shall not be applicable to contracts and agreements made under the
    authority herein granted to the Secretary. Notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, not to exceed  1/2  of 1 percent of funds
    apportioned to a State for the surface transportation program under
    section 104(b) and the bridge program under section 144 may be
    available to carry out this subsection upon request of the State
    transportation department to the Secretary.
      (c) The Secretary, in cooperation with any other department or
    agency of the Government, State agency, authority, association,
    institution, Indian tribal government, corporation (profit or
    nonprofit), or any other organization or person, is authorized to
    develop, conduct, and administer training programs and assistance
    programs in connection with any program under this title in order
    that minority businesses may achieve proficiency to compete, on an
    equal basis, for contracts and subcontracts. Whenever
    apportionments are made under section 104(b)(3), the Secretary
    shall deduct such sums as necessary, not to exceed $10,000,000 per
    fiscal year, for the administration of this subsection. The
    provisions of section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41 shall not be
    applicable to contracts and agreements made under the authority
    herein granted to the Secretary notwithstanding the provisions of
    section 3106 of title 41.
      (d) Indian Employment. - Consistent with section 703(i) of the
    Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(i)), nothing in this
    section shall preclude the preferential employment of Indians
    living on or near a reservation on projects and contracts on Indian
    reservation roads. States may implement a preference for employment
    of Indians on projects carried out under this title near Indian
    reservations. The Secretary shall cooperate with Indian tribal
    governments and the States to implement this subsection.

    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 141. Enforcement of requirements

-STATUTE-
      (a) Each State shall certify to the Secretary before January 1 of
    each year that it is enforcing all State laws respecting maximum
    vehicle size and weights permitted on the Federal-aid primary
    system, the Federal-aid urban system, and the Federal-aid secondary
    system, including the Interstate System in accordance with section
    127 of this title. Each State shall also certify that it is
    enforcing and complying with the provisions of section 127(d) of
    this title and section 31112 of title 49.
      (b)(1) Each State shall submit to the Secretary such information
    as the Secretary shall, by regulation, require as necessary, in his
    opinion, to verify the certification of such State under subsection
    (b) of this section.
      (2) If a State fails to certify as required by subsection (b) of
    this section or if the Secretary determines that a State is not
    adequately enforcing all State laws respecting such maximum vehicle
    size and weights, notwithstanding such a certification, then
    Federal-aid highway funds apportioned to such State for such fiscal
    year shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the
    amount which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under
    section 104 of this title.
      (3) If within one year from the date that the apportionment for
    any State is reduced in accordance with paragraph (2) of this
    subsection the Secretary determines that such State is enforcing
    all State laws respecting maximum size and weights, the
    apportionment of such State shall be increased by an amount equal
    to such reduction. If the Secretary does not make such a
    determination within such one-year period, the amounts so withheld
    shall be reapportioned to all other eligible States.
      (c) The Secretary shall reduce the State's apportionment of
    Federal-aid highway funds under section 104(b)(4) in an amount up
    to 25 per centum of the amount to be apportioned in any fiscal year
    beginning after September 30, 1984, during which heavy vehicles,
    subject to the use tax imposed by section 4481 of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986, may be lawfully registered in the State
    without having presented proof of payment, in such form as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the use tax imposed
    by section 4481 of such Code. Amounts withheld from apportionment
    to a State under this subsection shall be apportioned to the other
    States pursuant to the formulas of section 104(b)(4) and shall be
    available in the same manner and to the same extent as other

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) To encourage the development, improvement, and use of
    public mass transportation systems operating motor vehicles (other
    than on rail) on Federal-aid highways for the transportation of
    passengers (hereafter in this section referred to as "buses"), so
    as to increase the traffic capacity of the Federal-aid systems for
    the movement of persons, the Secretary may approve as a project on
    any Federal-aid system the construction of exclusive or
    preferential high occupancy vehicle lanes, highway traffic control
    devices, bus passenger loading areas and facilities (including
    shelters), and fringe and transportation corridor parking
    facilities to serve high occupancy vehicle and public mass
    transportation passengers, and sums apportioned under section
    104(b) of this title shall be available to finance the cost of
    projects under this paragraph. If fees are charged for the use of
    any parking facility constructed under this section, the rate
    thereof shall not be in excess of that required for maintenance and
    operation of the facility and the cost of providing shuttle service
    to and from the facility (including compensation to any person for
    operating the facility and for providing such shuttle service).
      (2) In addition to the projects under paragraph (1), the
    Secretary may approve as a project on the the (!1) surface
    transportation program for payment from sums apportioned under
    section 104(b)(3) for carrying out any capital transit project
    eligible for assistance under chapter 53 of title 49, capital
    improvement to provide access and coordination between intercity
    and rural bus service, and construction of facilities to provide
    connections between highway transportation and other modes of
    transportation.

      (b) Sums apportioned in accordance with section 104(b)(4) shall
    be available to finance the Federal share of projects for exclusive
    or preferential high occupancy vehicle, truck, and emergency
    vehicle routes or lanes. Routes constructed under this subsection
    shall not be subject to the third sentence of section 109(b) of
    this title.
      (c) Accommodation of Other Modes of Transportation. - The
    Secretary may approve as a project on any Federal-aid system for
    payment from sums apportioned under section 104(b) modifications to
    existing highway facilities on such system necessary to accommodate
    other modes of transportation if such modifications will not
    adversely affect automotive safety.
      (d) Metropolitan Planning. - Any project carried out under this
    section in an urbanized area shall be subject to the metropolitan
    planning requirements of section 134.
      (e)(1) For all purposes of this title, a project authorized by
    subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be deemed to be a highway
    project.
      (2) Notwithstanding section 209(f)(1) of the Highway Revenue Act
    of 1956, the Highway Trust Fund shall be available for making
    expenditures to meet obligations resulting from projects authorized
    by subsection (a)(2) of this section and such projects shall be
    subject to, and governed in accordance with, all provisions of this
    title applicable to projects on the surface transportation program,
    except to the extent determined inconsistent by the Secretary.
      (3) The Federal share payable on account of projects authorized
    by subsection (a) of this section shall be that provided in section
    120 of this title.
      (f) Availability of Rights-of-Way. - In any case where sufficient
    land or air space exits (!2) within the publicly acquired rights-of-
    way of any highway, constructed in whole or in part with Federal-
    aid highway funds, to accommodate needed passenger, commuter, or
    high speed rail, magnetic levitation systems, and highway and
    nonhighway public mass transit facilities, the Secretary shall
    authorize a State to make such lands, air space, and rights-of-way
    available with or without charge to a publicly or privately owned
    authority or company or any other person for such purposes if such
    accommodation will not adversely affect automotive safety.

      (g) The provision of assistance under subsection (a)(2) shall not
    be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of
    title 5, United States Code, any non-supervisory employee of an
    urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity
    performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise
    inapplicable.
      (h) Funds available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of
    subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be supplementary to and not
    in substitution for funds authorized and available for obligation
    pursuant to chapter 53 of title 49.
      (i) The provisions of section 5323(a)(1)(D) (!3) of title 49
    shall apply in carrying out subsection (a)(2) of this section.

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 1 - FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 144. Highway bridge program

-STATUTE-
      (a) Finding and Declaration. - Congress finds and declares that
    it is in the vital interest of the United States that a highway
    bridge program be carried out to enable States to improve the
    condition of their highway bridges over waterways, other
    topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads through
    replacement and rehabilitation of bridges that the States and the
    Secretary determine are structurally deficient or functionally
    obsolete and through systematic preventive maintenance of bridges.
      (b) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1)
    inventory all those highway bridges on any Federal-aid highway
    which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers,
    other highways, and railroads; (2) classify them according to
    serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use; (3) based
    on that classification, assign each a priority for replacement or
    rehabilitation; and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such
    bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.
      (c)(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1)
    inventory all those highway bridges on public roads, other than
    those on any Federal-aid highway, which are bridges over waterways,
    other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (2)
    classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality
    for public use, (3) based on the classification, assign each a
    priority for replacement or rehabilitation and (4) determine the
    cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of
    rehabilitating such bridge.
      (2) The Secretary may, at the request of a State, inventory
    bridges, on and off Federal-aid highways, for historic
    significance.
      (3) Inventory of indian reservation and park bridges. - As part
    of the activities carried out under paragraph (1), the Secretary,
    in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall (A)
    inventory all those highway bridges on Indian reservation roads and
    park roads which are bridges over waterways, other topographical
    barriers, other highways, and railroads, (B) classify them
    according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public
    use, (C) based on the classification, assign each a priority for
    replacement or rehabilitation, and (D) determine the cost of
    replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of
    rehabilitating such bridge.
      (d) Participation. - 
        (1) Bridge replacement and rehabilitation. - On application by
      a State or States to the Secretary for assistance for a highway
      bridge that has been determined to be eligible for replacement or
      rehabilitation under subsection (b) or (c), the Secretary may
      approve Federal participation in - 
          (A) replacing the bridge with a comparable facility; or
          (B) rehabilitating the bridge.

        (2) Types of assistance. - On application by a State or States
      to the Secretary, the Secretary may approve Federal assistance
      for any of the following activities for a highway bridge that has
      been determined to be eligible for replacement or rehabilitation
      under subsection (b) or (c):
          (A) Painting.
          (B) Seismic retrofit.
          (C) Systematic preventive maintenance.
          (D) Installation of scour countermeasures.
          (E) Application of calcium magnesium acetate, sodium
        acetate/formate, or other environmentally acceptable, minimally
        corrosive anti-icing and de-icing compositions.

        (3) Basis for determination. - The Secretary shall determine
      the eligibility of highway bridges for replacement or
      rehabilitation for each State based on structurally deficient and
      functionally obsolete highway bridges in the State.
        (4) Special rule for systematic preventive maintenance. -
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a State
      may carry out a project under paragraph (2)(B), (2)(C), or (2)(D)
      for a highway bridge without regard to whether the bridge is
      eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under this section.

      (e) Funds authorized to carry out this section shall be
    apportioned among the several States on October 1 of the fiscal
    year for which authorized in accordance with this subsection. Each
    deficient bridge shall be placed into one of the following
    categories: (1) Federal-aid highway bridges eligible for
    replacement, (2) Federal-aid highway bridges eligible for
    rehabilitation, (3) bridges not on Federal-aid highways eligible
    for replacement, and (4) bridges not on Federal-aid highways
    eligible for rehabilitation. The deck area of deficient bridges in
    each category shall be multiplied by the respective unit price on a
    State-by-State basis, as determined by the Secretary; and the total
    cost in each State divided by the total cost of the deficient
    bridges in all States shall determine the apportionment factors.
    For purposes of the preceding sentence, if a State transfers funds
    apportioned to the State under this section in a fiscal year
    beginning after September 30, 1997, to any other apportionment of
    funds to such State under this title, the total cost of deficient
    bridges in such State and in all States to be determined for the
    succeeding fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of such
    transferred funds. No State shall receive more than 10 per centum
    or less than 0.25 per centum of the total apportionment for any one
    fiscal year. The Secretary shall make these determinations based
    upon the latest available data, which shall be updated annually.
    Funds apportioned under this section shall be available for
    expenditure for the period specified in section 118(b)(2). Any
    funds not obligated at the expiration of such period shall be
    reapportioned by the Secretary to the other States in accordance
    with this subsection. The use of funds authorized under this
    section to carry out a project for the seismic retrofit of a bridge
    shall not affect the apportionment of funds under this section.
      (f) Bridge Set-asides. - 
        (1) Designated projects. - 
          (A) In general. - Of the amounts authorized to be
        appropriated to carry out the bridge program under this section
        for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2009, all but
        $100,000,000 shall be apportioned as provided in subsection
        (e). Such $100,000,000 shall be available as follows:
            (i) $12,500,000 per fiscal year for the Golden Gate Bridge.
            (ii) $18,750,000 per fiscal year for the construction of a
          bridge joining the Island of Gravina to the community of
          Ketchikan in Alaska.
            (iii) $12,500,000 per fiscal year to the State of Nevada
          for construction of a replacement of the federally owned
          bridge over the Hoover Dam in the Lake Mead National
          Recreation Area.
            (iv) $12,500,000 per fiscal year to the State of Missouri
          for construction of a structure over the Mississippi River to
          connect the City of St. Louis, Missouri, to the State of
          Illinois.
            (v) $12,500,000 per fiscal year for replacement and
          reconstruction of State maintained bridges in the State of
          Oklahoma.
            (vi) $4,500,000 per fiscal year for replacement of the
          Missisquoi Bay Bridge and the removal of the Missisquoi Bay
          causeway, Vermont.
            (vii) $8,000,000 per fiscal year for replacement and
          reconstruction of State-maintained bridges in the State of
          Vermont.
            (viii) $8,750,000 per fiscal year for design, planning, and
          right-of-way acquisition for the Interstate Route 74 bridge
          from Bettendorf, Iowa, to Moline, Illinois.
            (ix) $10,000,000 per fiscal year for replacement and
          reconstruction of State-maintained bridges in the State of
          Oregon.

          (B) Gravina access scoring. - The project described in
        subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not be counted for purposes of the
        reduction set forth in the fourth sentence of subsection (e).
          (C) Period of availability. - Amounts made available to a
        State under this paragraph shall remain available until
        expended.

        (2) Bridges not on federal-aid highways. - 
          (A) In general. - Not less than 15 percent of the amount
        apportioned to each State in each of fiscal years 2005 through
        2009 shall be expended for projects to replace, rehabilitate,
        paint, perform systematic preventive maintenance or seismic
        retrofit of, or apply calcium magnesium acetate, sodium
        acetate/formate, or other environmentally acceptable, minimally
        corrosive anti-icing and de-icing compositions to, or install
        scour countermeasures to, highway bridges located on public
        roads, other than those on a Federal-aid highway, or to
        complete the Warwick Intermodal Station (including the
        construction of a people mover between the Station and the T.F.
        Green Airport).
          (B) Reduction of expenditures. - The Secretary, after
        consultation with State and local officials, may reduce the
        requirement for expenditure for bridges not on a Federal-aid
        highway under subparagraph (A) with respect to the State if the
        Secretary determines that the State has inadequate needs to
        justify the expenditure.

      (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the General
    Bridge Act of 1946 (33 U.S.C. 525-533) shall apply to bridges
    authorized to be replaced, in whole or in part, by this section,
    except that subsection (b) of section 502 of such Act of 1946 and
    section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (30 Stat. 1151) shall not
    apply to any bridge constructed, reconstructed, rehabilitated, or
    replaced with assistance under this title, if such bridge is over
    waters (1) which are not used and are not susceptible to use in
    their natural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to
    transport interstate or foreign commerce, and (2) which are (a) not
    tidal, or (b) if tidal, used only by recreational boating, fishing,
    and other small vessels less than 21 feet in length.
      (h) Inventories and Reports. - The Secretary shall - 
        (1) report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of
      the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
      of the House of Representatives on projects approved under this
      section;
        (2) annually revise the current inventories authorized by
      subsections (b) and (c) of this section;
        (3) report to such committees on such inventories; and
        (4) report to such committees such recommendations as the
      Secretary may have for improvements of the program authorized by
      this section.

    Such reports shall be submitted to such committees biennially.
      (i) Sums apportioned to a State under this section shall be made
    available for obligation throughout such State on a fair and
    equitable basis.
      (j) Not later than six months after the date of enactment of this
    subsection, and periodically thereafter, the Secretary shall review
    the procedure used in approving or disapproving applications
    submitted under this section to determine what changes, if any, may
    be made to expedite such procedure. Any such changes shall be
    implemented by the Secretary as soon as possible. Not later than
    nine months after the date of enactment of this subsection, the
    Secretary shall submit a report to Congress which describes such
    review and such changes, including any recommendations for
    legislative changes.
      (k) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any bridge which
    is owned and operated by an agency (1) which does not have taxing
    powers, (2) whose functions include operating a federally assisted
    public transit system subsidized by toll revenues, shall be
    eligible for assistance under this section but the amount of such
    assistance shall in no event exceed the cumulative amount which
    such agency has expended for capital and operating costs to
    subsidize such transit system. Before authorizing an expenditure of
    funds under this subsection, the Secretary shall determine that the
    applicant agency has insufficient reserves, surpluses, and
    projected revenues (over and above those required for bridge and
    transit capital and operating costs) to fund the necessary bridge
    replacement or rehabilitation project. Any non-Federal funds
    expended for the seismic retrofit of the bridge may be credited
    toward the non-Federal share required as a condition of receipt of
    any Federal funds for seismic retrofit of the bridge made available
    after the date of the expenditure.
      (l) Replacement of Destroyed Bridges and Ferryboat Service. - 
        (1) General rule. - Notwithstanding any other provision of this
      section or of any other provision of law, a State may utilize any
      of the funds provided under this section to construct any bridge
      which - 
          (A) replaces any low water crossing (regardless of the length
        of such low water crossing),
          (B) replaces any bridge which was destroyed prior to 1965,
          (C) replaces any ferry which was in existence on January 1,
        1984, or
          (D) replaces any road bridges rendered obsolete as a result
        of United States Corps of Engineers flood control or
        channelization projects and not rebuilt with funds from the
        United States Corps of Engineers.

        (2) Federal share. - The Federal share payable on any bridge
      construction carried out under paragraph (1) shall be 80 percent
      of the cost of such construction.

      (m) Program for Bridges Not on Federal-Aid Highways. -
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to any
    project not on a Federal-aid highway for the replacement of a
    bridge or rehabilitation of a bridge which is wholly funded from
    State and local sources, is eligible for Federal funds under this
    section, is noncontroversial, is certified by the State to have
    been carried out in accordance with all standards applicable to
    such projects under this section, and is determined by the
    Secretary upon completion to be no longer a deficient bridge, any
    amount expended after the date of the enactment of this subsection
    from State and local sources for such project in excess of 20
    percent of the cost of construction thereof may be credited to the
    non-Federal share of the cost of the projects in such State which
    are eligible for Federal funds under this section. Such crediting
    shall be in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary may
    establish.
      (n) Historic Bridge Program. - 
        (1) Coordination. - The Secretary shall, in cooperation with
      the States, implement the programs described in this section in a
      manner that encourages the inventory, retention, rehabilitation,
      adaptive reuse, and future study of historic bridges.
        (2) State inventory. - The Secretary shall require each State
      to complete an inventory of all bridges on and off Federal-aid
      highways to determine their historic significance.
        (3) Eligibility. - Reasonable costs associated with actions to
      preserve, or reduce the impact of a project under this chapter
      on, the historic integrity of historic bridges shall be eligible
      as reimbursable project costs under this title (including this
      section) if the load capacity and safety features of the bridge
      are adequate to serve the intended use for the life of the
      bridge; except that in the case of a bridge which is no longer
      used for motorized vehicular traffic, the costs eligible as
      reimbursable project costs pursuant to this subsection shall not
      exceed the estimated cost of demolition of such bridge.
        (4) Preservation. - Any State which proposes to demolish a
      historic bridge for a replacement project with funds made
      available to carry out this section shall first make the bridge
      available for donation to a State, locality, or responsible
      private entity if such State, locality, or responsible entity
      enters into an agreement to - 
          (A) maintain the bridge and the features that give it its
        historic significance; and
          (B) assume all future legal and financial responsibility for
        the bridge, which may include an agreement to hold the State
        transportation department harmless in any liability action.

      Costs incurred by the State to preserve the historic bridge,
      including funds made available to the State, locality, or private
      entity to enable it to accept the bridge, shall be eligible as
      reimbursable project costs under this chapter up to an amount not
      to exceed the cost of demolition. Any bridge preserved pursuant
      to this paragraph shall thereafter not be eligible for any other
      funds authorized pursuant to this title.
        (5) Historic bridge defined. - As used in this subsection,
      "historic bridge" means any bridge that is listed on, or eligible
      for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places.

      (o) Applicability of State Standards for Projects. - A project
    not on a Federal-aid highway under this section shall be designed,
    constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with State
    laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design standards,
    and construction standards.
      (p) As used in this section the term "rehabilitate" in any of its
    forms means major work necessary to restore the structural
    integrity of a bridge as well as work necessary to correct a major
    safety defect.
      (q) Annual Materials Report on New Bridge Construction and Bridge
    Rehabilitation. - Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
    of this subsection, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall
    publish in the Federal Register a report describing construction
    materials used in new Federal-aid bridge construction and bridge
    rehabilitation projects.
      (r) Federal Share. - 
        (1) In general. - Except as provided under paragraph (2), the
      Federal share of the cost of a project payable from funds made
      available to carry out this section shall be determined under
      section 120(b).
        (2) Interstate system. - The Federal share of the cost of a
      project on the Interstate System payable from funds made

      "(g) The Secretary of Transportation shall not approve any
    project under subsection (d) or (e) of this section or under
    section 146 of title 23, United States Code; which will have an
    adverse effect on any mass transportation system.
      "(h) The Secretary of Transportation is directed to study the
    administrative effectiveness of carpooling and vanpooling programs
    within the Department of Transportation, including programs of the
    Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration,
    and the Office of the Secretary. Such study shall be completed no
    later than September 30, 1979. Upon completion of such study, the
    Secretary shall propose a plan to centralize or modify such
    programs to make delivery of services and grants more efficient,
    more cost-effective, and to avoid duplication of effort. Such plan
    shall list statutory changes needed to implement such a plan, which
    shall be sent to Congress no later than March 30, 1980."

    Sec. 152. Hazard elimination program

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - 
        (1) Program. - Each State shall conduct and systematically
      maintain an engineering survey of all public roads to identify
      hazardous locations, sections, and elements, including roadside
      obstacles and unmarked or poorly marked roads, which may
      constitute a danger to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians,
      assign priorities for the correction of such locations, sections,
      and elements, and establish and implement a schedule of projects
      for their improvement.
        (2) Hazards. - In carrying out paragraph (1), a State may, at
      its discretion - 
          (A) identify, through a survey, hazards to motorists,
        bicyclists, pedestrians, and users of highway facilities; and
          (B) develop and implement projects and programs to address
        the hazards.

    for expenditure on - 
        (1) any public road;
        (2) any public surface transportation facility or any publicly
      owned bicycle or pedestrian pathway or trail; or
        (3) any traffic calming measure.

      (d) The Federal share payable on account of any project under
    this section shall be 90 percent of the cost thereof.
      (e) Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section
    shall be available for obligation in the same manner and to the
    same extent as if such funds were apportioned under section 104(b),
    except that the Secretary is authorized to waive provisions he
    deems inconsistent with the purposes of this section.
      (f) Each State shall establish an evaluation process approved by
    the Secretary, to analyze and assess results achieved by safety
    improvement projects carried out in accordance with procedures and
    criteria established by this section. Such evaluation process shall
    develop cost-benefit data for various types of corrections and
    treatments which shall be used in setting priorities for safety
    improvement projects.
      (g) Each State shall report to the Secretary of Transportation
    not later than December 30 of each year, on the progress being made
    to implement safety improvement projects for hazard elimination and
    the effectiveness of such improvements. Each State report shall
    contain an assessment of the cost of, and safety benefits derived
    from, the various means and methods used to mitigate or eliminate
    hazards and the previous and subsequent accident experience at
    these locations. The Secretary of Transportation shall submit a
    report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the
    Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of
    the House of Representatives not later than April 1 of each year on
    the progress being made by the States in implementing the hazard
    elimination program (including but not limited to any projects for
    pavement marking). The report shall include, but not be limited to,
    the number of projects undertaken, their distribution by cost
    range, road system, means and methods used, and the previous and
    subsequent accident experience at improved locations. In addition,
    the Secretary's report shall analyze and evaluate each State
    program, identify any State found not to be in compliance with the
    schedule of improvements required by subsection (a) and include
    recommendations for future implementation of the hazard elimination
    program.
      (h) For the purposes of this section the term "State" shall have
    the meaning given it in section 401 of this title.

    in an amount determined by multiplying - 
        (1) the amount authorized to carry out this section for the

-STATUTE-
      Funds authorized for forest development roads and trails, public
    lands development roads and trails, park road, parkways, refuge
    roads, Indian reservation roads, and public lands highways shall be
    available for contract upon apportionment, or on October 1, of the

        approved Bureau of Land Management resource management plan or
        has been released to uses other than wilderness by an Act of

      (h) Project Administration. - 
        (1) Credit for donations of funds, materials, services, or new
      right-of-way. - 
          (A) In general. - Nothing in this title or other law shall
        prevent a project sponsor from offering to donate funds,
        materials, services, or a new right-of-way for the purposes of
        a project eligible for assistance under this section. Any
        funds, or the fair market value of any materials, services, or
        new right-of-way, may be donated by any project sponsor and

          (C) Planning and environmental assessment costs incurred
        prior to project approval. - The Secretary may allow
        preapproval planning and environmental compliance costs to be
        credited toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a project
        described in subsection (d)(2) (other than subparagraph (H)) in
        accordance with subsection (f), limited to costs incurred less
        than 18 months prior to project approval.

        (2) Recreational purpose. - A project funded under this section
      is intended to enhance recreational opportunity and is not
      subject to section 138 of this title or section 303 of title 49.
        (3) Continuing recreational use. - At the option of each State,
      funds apportioned to the State to carry out this section may be
      treated as Land and Water Conservation Fund apportionments for
      the purposes of section 6(f)(3) of the Land and Water

        assurances that the owner of the land will cooperate with the
        State and participate as necessary in the activities to be
        conducted.
          (B) Public access. - Any use of the apportionments to a State
        to carry out this section on privately owned land must be
        accompanied by an easement or other legally binding agreement
        that ensures public access to the recreational trail
        improvements funded by the apportionments.

      (i) Contract Authority. - Funds authorized to carry out this
    section shall be available for obligation in the same manner as if

-EXPCITE-
    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 2 - OTHER HIGHWAYS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 210. Defense access roads

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The Secretary is authorized, out of the funds appropriated
    for defense access roads, to provide for the construction and
    maintenance of defense access roads (including bridges, tubes, and
    tunnels thereon) to military reservations, to defense industries
    and defense industry sites, and to the sources of raw materials
    when such roads are certified to the Secretary as important to the
    national defense by the Secretary of Defense or such other official
    as the President may designate, and for replacing existing highways
    and highway connections that are shut off from the general public
    use by necessary closures or restrictions at military reservations
    and defense industry sites.
      (2) If it is determined that an action of the Department of
    Defense will cause a significant transportation impact to access to
    a military reservation, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct a
    transportation needs assessment to assess the magnitude of the
    improvement required to address the impact. The Secretary of
    Defense shall determine the magnitude of the required improvements
    without regard to the extent to which traffic generated by the
    reservation is greater than other traffic in the vicinity of the
    reservation.
      (b) Funds appropriated for the purposes of this section shall be
    available, without regard to apportionment among the several
    States, for paying all or any part of the cost of the construction
    and maintenance of defense access roads.
      (c) Funds appropriated for defense maneuvers and exercises, may
    be used by the Secretary in areas certified to him by the Secretary
    of Defense as maneuver areas for such construction, maintenance,
    and repair work as may be necessary to keep the highways therein,
    which have been or may be used for training of the Armed Forces, in
    suitable condition for such training purposes and for repairing the
    damage caused to such highways by the operations of men and
    equipment in such training.
      (d) Whenever any project for the construction of a
    circumferential highway around a city or of a radial intracity
    route thereto submitted by any State is certified by the Secretary
    of Defense, or such other official as the President may designate,
    as being important for civilian or military defense, such project
    may be constructed out of the funds heretofore or hereafter
    authorized to be appropriated for defense access roads.
      (e) If the Secretary shall determine that the State
    transportation department of any State is unable to obtain
    possession and the right to enter upon and use the required rights-
    of-way, lands, or interest in lands, improved or unimproved,
    required for any project authorized by this section with sufficient
    promptness, the Secretary is authorized to acquire, enter upon,
    take possession thereof, and expend funds for projects thereon,
    prior to approval of title by the Attorney General, in the name of
    the United States, such rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands
    as may be required in such State for such projects by purchase,
    donation, condemnation, or otherwise in accordance with the laws of
    the United States (including sections 3114 to 3116 and 3118 of
    title 40). The cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring any such
    rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands may include the cost of
    examination and abstract of title, certificate of title,
    advertising, and any fees incidental to such acquisition; and shall
    be payable out of the funds available for paying the cost or the
    Federal share of the cost of the project for which such rights-of-
    way, lands, or interests in lands are acquired. The Secretary is
    further authorized and directed by proper deed executed in the name
    of the United States to convey any lands or interests in lands
    acquired in any State under the provisions of prior Acts or of this
    section to the State transportation department of such State or to
    such political subdivision thereof as its laws may provide, upon
    such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary
    and the State transportation department, or political subdivisions
    to which the conveyance is to be made.
      (f) The provisions of section 112 of this title are applicable to
    defense access roads.
      (g) If the Secretary shall determine that it is necessary for the
    expeditious completion of any defense access road project he may
    advance to any State out of funds appropriated for defense access
    roads transferred and available to the Department of Transportation
    the Federal share of the cost of construction thereof to enable the
    State transportation department to make prompt payments for
    acquisition of rights-of-way, and for the construction as it
    progresses. The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special
    fund by the State official authorized by State law to receive such
    funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State
    transportation department for rights-of-way which have been or are
    being acquired and for construction which has been actually
    performed under this section. Upon determination by the Secretary
    that funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this
    subsection are no longer required, the amount of the advance which
    is determined to be in excess of requirements for the project shall
    be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to
    the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced.
      (h) Funds appropriated for the purposes of this section shall be
    available to pay the cost of repairing damage caused to highways by
    the operation of vehicles and equipment in the construction of
    classified military installations and facilities for ballistic
    missiles if the Secretary shall determine that the State
    transportation department of any State is, or has been, unable to
    prevent such damage by restrictions upon the use of such highways
    without interference with, or delay in, the completion of a
    contract for the construction of such military reservations or
    installations. This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any
    provision of contract holding a party thereto responsible for such
    damage, if the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall
    determine, in fact, that construction estimates and the bid of such
    party did not include allowance for repairing such damage. This
    subsection shall apply to damage caused by construction work
    commenced prior to June 1, 1961, and still in progress on that date
    and construction work which is commenced or for which a contract is
    awarded on or after June 1, 1961.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 212. Inter-American Highway

-STATUTE-
      (a) Funds appropriated for the Inter-American Highway shall be
    used to enable the United States to cooperate with the Governments
    of the American Republics situated in Central America - that is,
    with the Governments of the Republic of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
    Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama - in the survey and
    construction of the Inter-American Highway within the borders of
    the aforesaid Republics, respectively. Not to exceed one-third of
    the appropriation authorized for each fiscal year may be expended
    without requiring the country or countries in which such funds may
    be expended to match any part thereof, if the Secretary of State
    shall find that the cost of constructing said highway in such
    country or countries will be beyond their reasonable capacity to
    bear. The remainder of such authorized appropriations shall be
    available for expenditure only when matched to the extent required
    by this section by the country in which such expenditure may be
    made. Expenditures from the funds available on a matching basis
    shall not be made for the survey and construction of any portion of
    said highway within the borders of any country named herein unless
    such country shall provide and make available for expenditure in
    conjunction therewith a sum equal to at least one-third of the
    expenditures that may be incurred by that Government and the United
    States on such portion of the highway. All expenditures by the
    United States under the provisions of this section for material,
    equipment, and supplies shall, whenever practicable, be made for
    products of the United States or of the country in which such
    survey or construction work is being carried on. Construction work
    to be performed under contract shall be advertised for a reasonable
    period by the Minister of Public Works, or other similar official,
    of the government concerned in each of the participating countries
    and contracts shall be awarded pursuant to such advertisements with
    the approval of the Secretary. No part of the appropriations
    authorized shall be available for obligation or expenditure for
    work on said highway in any cooperating country unless the
    government of said country shall have assented to the provisions of
    this section; shall have furnished satisfactory assurances that it
    has an organization adequately qualified to administer the
    functions required of such country under the provisions hereof; and
    then only as such country may submit requests, from time to time,
    for the construction of any portion of the highway to standards
    adequate to meet present and future traffic needs. No part of said
    appropriations shall be available for obligation or expenditure in
    any such country until the government of that country shall have
    entered into an agreement with the United States which shall
    provide, in part, that said country - 
        (1) will provide, without participation of funds authorized,
      all necessary rights-of-way for the construction of said highway,
      which rights-of-way shall be of a minimum width where practicable
      of one hundred meters in rural areas and fifty meters in
      municipalities and shall forever be held inviolate as a part of
      the highway for public use;
        (2) will not impose any highway toll, or permit any such toll
      to be charged, for use by vehicles or persons of any portion of
      said highway constructed under the provisions of this section;
        (3) will not levy or assess, directly or indirectly, any fee,
      tax, or other charge for the use of said highway by vehicles or
      persons from the United States that does not apply equally to
      vehicles or persons of such country;
        (4) will continue to grant reciprocal recognition of vehicle
      registration and drivers' licenses in accordance with the
      provisions of the Convention for the Regulation of Inter-American
      Automotive Traffic, which was opened for signature at the Pan
      American Union in Washington on December 15, 1943, and to which
      such country and the United States are parties, or of any other
      treaty or international convention establishing similar
      reciprocal recognition; and
        (5) will provide for the maintenance of said highway after its
      completion in condition adequately to serve the needs of present
      and future traffic.

      (b) The survey and construction work authorized by this section
    shall be under the administration of the Secretary, who shall
    consult with the appropriate officials of the Department of State
    with respect to matters involving the foreign relations of this
    Government, and such negotiations with the Governments of the
    American Republics named in subsection (a) of this section as may
    be required to carry out the purposes of this section shall be
    conducted through, or as authorized by, the Department of State.
      (c) The provisions of this section shall not create nor authorize
    the creation of any obligations on the part of the Government of
    the United States with respect to any expenditures for highway
    construction or survey heretofore or hereafter undertaken in any of
    the countries enumerated in subsection (a) of this section, other
    than the expenditures authorized by the provisions of this section.
      (d) Appropriations made pursuant to any authorizations
    heretofore, or hereafter enacted for the Inter-American Highway
    shall be considered available for expenditure by the Secretary for
    necessary administrative and engineering expenses in connection
    with the Inter-American Highway program.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of
    Transportation shall not obligate any funds authorized to be
    appropriated to carry out the Surface Transportation Assistance Act
    of 1982 (96 Stat. 2097) or this title and administered by the
    Department of Transportation, unless steel, iron, and manufactured
    products used in such project are produced in the United States.
      (b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not
    apply where the Secretary finds - 
        (1) that their application would be inconsistent with the
      public interest;
        (2) that such materials and products are not produced in the
      United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities
      and of a satisfactory quality; or
        (3) that inclusion of domestic material will increase the cost
      of the overall project contract by more than 25 percent.

      (c) For purposes of this section, in calculating components'
    costs, labor costs involved in final assembly shall not be included
    in the calculation.
      (d) The Secretary of Transportation shall not impose any
    limitation or condition on assistance provided under the Surface
    Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 2097) or this title
    that restricts any State from imposing more stringent requirements
    than this section on the use of articles, materials, and supplies
    mined, produced, or manufactured in foreign countries in projects
    carried out with such assistance or restricts any recipient of such
    assistance from complying with such State imposed requirements.
      (e) Intentional Violations. - If it has been determined by a
    court or Federal agency that any person intentionally - 
        (1) affixed a label bearing a "Made in America" inscription, or
      any inscription with the same meaning, to any product used in
      projects to which this section applies, sold in or shipped to the
      United States that was not made in the United States; or
        (2) represented that any product used in projects to which this
      section applies, sold in or shipped to the United States that was
      not produced in the United States, was produced in the United
      States;

    that person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or
    subcontract made with funds authorized under the Intermodal Surface
    Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 pursuant to the debarment,
    suspension, and ineligibility procedures in subpart 9.4 of chapter
    1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.
      (f) Limitation on Applicability of Waivers to Products Produced
    in Certain Foreign Countries. - If the Secretary, in consultation
    with the United States Trade Representative, determines that - 
        (1) a foreign country is a party to an agreement with the
      United States and pursuant to that agreement the head of an
      agency of the United States has waived the requirements of this
      section, and
        (2) the foreign country has violated the terms of the agreement
      by discriminating against products covered by this section that
      are produced in the United States and are covered by the
      agreement,

    the provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to products
    produced in that foreign country.

                             PRIOR PROVISIONS                         
      A prior section 313, Pub. L. 85-767, Aug. 27, 1958, 72 Stat. 915,
    authorized the Secretary to cooperate with State highway
    departments and other agencies in the promotion of highway safety
    and authorized the expenditure of $150,000 out of the
    administrative funds made available in accordance with section
    104(a) of this title for the purposes of this section, prior to
    repeal by Pub. L. 89-564, title I, Sec. 102(a), Sept. 9, 1966, 80
    Stat. 734. See section 401 et seq. of this title.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2005 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109-59, Sec. 1903(c)(1), substituted
    "to carry out the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (96
    Stat. 2097) or this title" for "by this Act or by any Act amended
    by this Act or, after the date of enactment of this Act, any funds
    authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act, title 23,
    United States Code, or the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of
    1978".

    directed amendment of this section by striking subsec. (e) and
    redesignating subsecs. (f) and (g) as (e) and (f), respectively,

        public comment on such finding for a period of not to exceed 60
        days.
        "(2) Limitation on statutory construction. - Nothing in
      paragraph (1) shall be construed to require the effective date of
      a finding referred to in paragraph (1) to be delayed until after
      the close of the public comment period referred to in paragraph
      (1)(B).
      "(b) Annual Reports. - Not later than February 1 of each year
    beginning after the date of enactment of this Act [June 6, 2008],

    CHAPTER 3 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 320. Bridges on Federal dams

-STATUTE-
      (a) Each executive department, independent establishment, office,
    board, bureau, commission, authority, administration, corporation
    wholly owned or controlled by the United States, or other agency of
    the Government of the United States, hereinafter collectively and
    individually referred to as "agency", which on or after July 29,
    1946, has jurisdiction over and custody of any dam constructed or
    to be constructed and owned by or for the United States, is
    authorized, with any funds available to it, to design and construct
    any such dam in such manner that it will constitute and serve as a
    suitable and adequate foundation to support a public highway bridge
    upon and across such dam, and to design and construct upon the
    foundation thus provided a public highway bridge upon and across
    such dam. The highway department of the State in which such dam
    shall be located, jointly with the Secretary, shall first determine
    and certify to such agency that such bridge is economically
    desirable and needed as a link in the State or Federal-aid highway
    systems, and shall request such agency to design and construct such
    dam so that it will serve as a suitable and adequate foundation for
    a public highway bridge and to design and construct such public
    highway bridge upon and across such dam, and shall agree to
    reimburse such agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section
    for any additional costs which it may be required to incur because
    of the design and construction of such dam so that it will serve as
    a foundation for a public highway bridge and for expenditures which
    it may find it necessary to make in designing and constructing such
    public highway bridge upon and across such dam. In no case shall
    the design and construction of a bridge upon and across such dam be
    undertaken hereunder except by the agency having jurisdiction over
    and custody of the dam, acting directly or through contractors
    employed by it, and after such agency shall determine that it will
    be structurally feasible and will not interfere with the proper
    functioning and operation of the dam.
      (b) Construction of any bridge upon and across any dam pursuant
    to this section shall not be commenced unless and until the State
    in which such bridge is to be located, or the appropriate
    subdivision of such State, shall enter into an agreement with such
    agency and with the Secretary to construct, or cause to be
    constructed, with or without the aid of Federal funds, the approach
    roads necessary to connect such bridge with existing public
    highways and to maintain, or cause to be maintained, such approach
    roads from and after their completion. Such agreement may also
    provide for the design and construction of such bridge upon and
    across the dam by such agency of the United States and for
    reimbursing such agency the costs incurred by it in the design and
    construction of the bridge as provided in subsection (d) of this
    section. Any such agency is hereby authorized to convey to the
    State, or to the appropriate subdivision thereof, without costs,
    such easements and rights-of-way in its custody or over lands of
    the United States in its custody and control as may be necessary,
    convenient, or proper for the location, construction, and
    maintenance of the approach roads referred to in this section
    including such roadside parks or recreational areas of limited size
    as may be deemed necessary for the accommodation of the traveling
    public. Any bridge constructed pursuant to this section upon and
    across a dam in the custody and jurisdiction of any agency of the
    United States, including such portion thereof, if any, as may
    extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall constitute and
    remain a part of said dam and be maintained by the agency. Any such
    agency may enter into any such contracts and agreements with the
    State or its subdivisions respecting public use of any bridge so
    located and constructed as may be deemed appropriate, but no such
    bridge shall be closed to public use by the agency except in cases
    of emergency or when deemed necessary in the interest of national
    security.
      (c) All costs and expenses incurred and expenditures made by any
    agency in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred by
    this section (but not including any costs, expenses, or
    expenditures which would have been required in any event to satisfy
    a legal road or bridge relocation obligation or to meet operating
    or other agency needs) shall be recorded and kept separate and
    apart from the other costs, expenses, and expenditures of such
    agency, and no portion thereof shall be charged or allocated to
    flood control, navigation, irrigation, fertilizer production, the
    national defense, the development of power, or other program,
    purpose, or function of such agency.
      (d) Not to exceed $65,000,000 of any money heretofore or
    hereafter appropriated for expenditure in accordance with the
    provisions of this title or prior Acts shall be available for
    expenditure by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of
    this section, as an emergency fund, to reimburse any agency for any
    additional costs or expenditures which it may be required to incur
    because of the design and construction of any such dam so that it
    will constitute and serve as a foundation for a public highway
    bridge upon and across such dam and to reimburse any such agency
    for any costs, expenses, or expenditures which it may be required
    to make in designing and constructing any such bridge upon and
    across a dam in accordance with the provisions of this section,
    except such costs, expenses, or expenditures as would have been
    required of such agency in any event to satisfy a legal obligation
    to relocate a highway or bridge or to meet operating or other
    agency needs, and there is authorized to be appropriated any sum or
    sums necessary to reimburse the funds so expended by the Secretary
    from time to time under the authority of this section. Of each
    bridge constructed upon and across a dam under the provisions of
    this section, there may be financed wholly with Federal funds that
    portion thereof which is located within the physical limits of the
    masonry structure, or structures, of the dam, and the Secretary
    shall in his sole discretion determine what additional portion of
    the bridge, if any, may be so financed, such determination to be
    final and conclusive. The remainder of the bridge, and any
    necessary related approach roads, shall be financed by the State or
    its appropriate subdivision with or without the aid of Federal
    funds; but said portion of the bridge so financed by the State or
    its subdivisions, including such portion thereof, if any, as may
    extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall nevertheless be
    designed and constructed solely by the agency having custody and
    jurisdiction of the dam as provided in subsection (a) of this
    section.
      (e) In making, reviewing, or approving the design of any bridge
    or approach structure to be constructed under this section, the
    agency shall, in matters relating to roadway design, loadings,
    clearances and widths, and traffic safeguards, give full
    consideration to and be guided by the standards and advice of the
    Secretary.
      (f) The authority conferred by this section shall be in addition
    to and not in limitation of authority conferred upon any agency by
    any other law, and nothing in this section contained shall affect
    or be deemed to relate to any bridge, approach structure, or
    highway constructed or to be constructed by any such agency in
    furtherance of its lawful purposes and requirements or to satisfy a
    legal obligation incurred independently of this section.

    organizations equipped and experienced to conduct such campaign.
      "(f) The Secretary of Transportation shall engage such private
    firms or organizations as he determines necessary to conduct an on-
    going evaluation of the national campaign authorized by subsection
    (d) of this section to determine ways and means for encouraging the
    participation and cooperation of television and radio station
    licensees, for measuring audience reactions to on-going highway
    safety programming for evaluating the effectiveness of such
    programs in terms of the number of lives saved and the reduction in
    injuries, and for the purpose of developing new programs for the
    promotion of highway safety. Such evaluation shall include
    determinations of those programs designed to encourage the
    voluntary use of safety belts which are most effective and shall
    include recommendations for new methods and approaches which will
    result in greater voluntary utilization of safety belts by the
    public.
      "(g) The Secretary of Transportation shall submit a report to the
    Congress on July 1 of each year in which the campaign is in
    progress on the results of such evaluation and on the steps being

    TITLE 23 - HIGHWAYS
    CHAPTER 4 - HIGHWAY SAFETY

-HEAD-
    Sec. 402. Highway safety programs

-STATUTE-
      (a) Each State shall have a highway safety program approved by
    the Secretary, designed to reduce traffic accidents and deaths,
    injuries, and property damage resulting therefrom. Such programs
    shall be in accordance with uniform guidelines promulgated by the
    Secretary. Such uniform guidelines shall be expressed in terms of
    performance criteria. In addition, such uniform guidelines shall
    include programs (1) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from
    motor vehicles being driven in excess of posted speed limits, (2)
    to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices
    (including the use of safety belts and child restraint systems) by
    occupants of motor vehicles, (3) to reduce deaths and injuries
    resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired by
    alcohol or a controlled substance, (4) to prevent accidents and
    reduce deaths and injuries resulting from accidents involving motor
    vehicles and motorcycles, (5) to reduce injuries and deaths
    resulting from accidents involving school buses, and (!1) (6) to
    reduce accidents resulting from unsafe driving behavior (including
    aggressive or fatigued driving and distracted driving arising from
    the use of electronic devices in vehicles) (!2) (7) to improve law
    enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic
    supervision, and post-accident procedures. The Secretary shall
    establish a highway safety program for the collection and reporting
    of data on traffic-related deaths and injuries by the States. Under
    such program, the States shall collect and report such data as the
    Secretary may require. The purposes of the program are to ensure
    national uniform data on such deaths and injuries and to allow the
    Secretary to make determinations for use in developing programs to
    reduce such deaths and injuries and making recommendations to
    Congress concerning legislation necessary to implement such
    programs. The program shall provide for annual reports to the
    Secretary on the efforts being made by the States in reducing
    deaths and injuries occurring at highway construction sites and the
    effectiveness and results of such efforts. The Secretary shall
    establish minimum reporting criteria for the program. Such criteria
    shall include, but not be limited to, criteria on deaths and
    injuries resulting from police pursuits, school bus accidents,
    aggressive driving, fatigued driving, distracted driving, and
    speeding, on traffic-related deaths and injuries at highway
    construction sites and on the configuration of commercial motor
    vehicles involved in motor vehicle accidents. Such uniform
    guidelines shall be promulgated by the Secretary so as to improve
    driver performance (including, but not limited to, driver
    education, driver testing to determine proficiency to operate motor
    vehicles, driver examinations (both physical and mental) and driver
    licensing) and to improve pedestrian performance and bicycle
    safety. In addition such uniform guidelines shall include, but not
    be limited to, provisions for an effective record system of
    accidents (including injuries and deaths resulting therefrom),
    accident investigations to determine the probable causes of
    accidents, injuries, and deaths, vehicle registration, operation,
    and inspection, highway design and maintenance (including lighting,
    markings, and surface treatment), traffic control, vehicle codes
    and laws, surveillance of traffic for detection and correction of
    high or potentially high accident locations, enforcement of light
    transmission standards of window glazing for passenger motor
    vehicles and light trucks as necessary to improve highway safety,
    and emergency services. Such guidelines as are applicable to State
    highway safety programs shall, to the extent determined appropriate
    by the Secretary, be applicable to federally administered areas
    where a Federal department or agency controls the highways or
    supervises traffic operations.


      (b) Administration of State Programs. - 
        (1) Administrative requirements. - The Secretary may not
      approve a State highway safety program under this section which
      does not - 
          (A) provide that the Governor of the State shall be
        responsible for the administration of the program through a
        State highway safety agency which shall have adequate powers
        and be suitably equipped and organized to carry out, to the
        satisfaction of the Secretary, such program;
          (B) authorize political subdivisions of the State to carry
        out local highway safety programs within their jurisdictions as
        a part of the State highway safety program if such local
        highway safety programs are approved by the Governor and are in
        accordance with the minimum standards established by the
        Secretary under this section;
          (C) except as provided in paragraph (3), provide that at
        least 40 percent of all Federal funds apportioned under this
        section to the State for any fiscal year will be expended by
        the political subdivisions of the State, including Indian
        tribal governments, in carrying out local highway safety
        programs authorized in accordance with subparagraph (B);
          (D) provide adequate and reasonable access for the safe and
        convenient movement of individuals with disabilities, including
        those in wheelchairs, across curbs constructed or replaced on
        or after July 1, 1976, at all pedestrian crosswalks throughout
        the State; and
          (E) provide satisfactory assurances that the State will
        implement activities in support of national highway safety
        goals to reduce motor vehicle related fatalities that also
        reflect the primary data-related crash factors within a State
        as identified by the State highway safety planning process,
        including - 
            (i) national law enforcement mobilizations;
            (ii) sustained enforcement of statutes addressing impaired
          driving, occupant protection, and driving in excess of posted
          speed limits;
            (iii) an annual statewide safety belt use survey in
          accordance with criteria established by the Secretary for the
          measurement of State safety belt use rates to ensure that the
          measurements are accurate and representative; and
            (iv) development of statewide data systems to provide
          timely and effective data analysis to support allocation of
          highway safety resources.

        (2) Waiver. - The Secretary may waive the requirement of
      paragraph (1)(C), in whole or in part, for a fiscal year for any
      State whenever the Secretary determines that there is an
      insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify
      the expenditure in the State of such percentage of Federal funds
      during the fiscal year.
        (3) Use of technology for traffic enforcement. - The Secretary
      may encourage States to use technologically advanced traffic
      enforcement devices (including the use of automatic speed
      detection devices such as photo-radar) by law enforcement
      officers.

      (c) Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section
    shall be used to aid the States to conduct the highway safety
    programs approved in accordance with subsection (a), including
    development and implementation of manpower training programs, and
    of demonstration programs that the Secretary determines will
    contribute directly to the reduction of accidents, and deaths and
    injuries resulting therefrom. Such funds shall be apportioned 75
    per centum in the ratio which the population of each State bears to
    the total population of all the States, as shown by the latest
    available Federal census, and 25 per centum in the ratio which the
    public road mileage in each State bears to the total public road
    mileage in all States. For the purposes of this subsection, a
    "public road" means any road under the jurisdiction of and
    maintained by a public authority and open to public travel. Public
    road mileage as used in this subsection shall be determined as of
    the end of the calendar year preceding the year in which the funds
    are apportioned and shall be certified to by the Governor of the
    State and subject to approval by the Secretary. The annual
    apportionment to each State shall not be less than three-quarters
    of 1 percent of the total apportionment, except that the
    apportionment to the Secretary of the Interior shall not be less
    than 2 percent of the total apportionment and the apportionments to
    the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of
    the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be less than one-quarter of
    1 per centum of the total apportionment. The Secretary shall not
    apportion any funds under this subsection to any State which is not
    implementing a highway safety program approved by the Secretary in
    accordance with this section. For the purpose of the seventh
    sentence of this subsection, a highway safety program approved by
    the Secretary shall not include any requirement that a State
    implement such a program by adopting or enforcing any law, rule, or
    regulation based on a guideline promulgated by the Secretary under
    this section requiring any motorcycle operator eighteen years of
    age or older or passenger eighteen years of age or older to wear a
    safety helmet when operating or riding a motorcycle on the streets
    and highways of that State. Implementation of a highway safety
    program under this section shall not be construed to require the
    Secretary to require compliance with every uniform guideline, or
    with every element of every uniform guideline, in every State.
    Funds apportioned under this section to any State, that does not
    have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary or that is
    not implementing an approved program, shall be reduced by amounts
    equal to not less than 50 per centum of the amounts that would
    otherwise be apportioned to the State under this section, until
    such time as the Secretary approves such program or determines that
    the State is implementing an approved program, as appropriate. The
    Secretary shall consider the gravity of the State's failure to have
    or implement an approved program in determining the amount of the
    reduction. The Secretary shall promptly apportion to the State the
    funds withheld from its apportionment if he approves the State's
    highway safety program or determines that the State has begun
    implementing an approved program, as appropriate, prior to the end
    of the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld. If the
    Secretary determines that the State did not correct its failure
    within such period, the Secretary shall reapportion the withheld
    funds to the other States in accordance with the formula specified
    in this subsection not later than 30 days after such determination.
      (d) All provisions of chapter 1 of this title that are applicable
    to National Highway System highway funds other than provisions
    relating to the apportionment formula and provisions limiting the
    expenditure of such funds to the Federal-aid systems, shall apply
    to the highway safety funds authorized to be appropriated to carry
    out this section, except as determined by the Secretary to be
    inconsistent with this section, and except that the aggregate of
    all expenditures made during any fiscal year by a State and its
    political subdivisions (exclusive of Federal funds) for carrying
    out the State highway safety program (other than planning and
    administration) shall be available for the purpose of crediting
    such State during such fiscal year for the non-Federal share of the
    cost of any project under this section (other than one for planning
    or administration) without regard to whether such expenditures were
    actually made in connection with such project and except that, in
    the case of a local highway safety program carried out by an Indian
    tribe, if the Secretary is satisfied that an Indian tribe does not
    have sufficient funds available to meet the non-Federal share of
    the cost of such program, he may increase the Federal share of the
    cost thereof payable under this Act to the extent necessary. In
    applying such provisions of chapter 1 in carrying out this section
    the term "State transportation department" as used in such
    provisions shall mean the Governor of a State for the purposes of
    this section.
      (e) Uniform guidelines promulgated by the Secretary to carry out
    this section shall be developed in cooperation with the States,
    their political subdivisions, appropriate Federal departments and
    agencies, and such other public and private organizations as the
    Secretary deems appropriate.
      (f) The Secretary may make arrangements with other Federal
    departments and agencies for assistance in the preparation of
    uniform guidelines for the highway safety programs contemplated by
    subsection (a) and in the administration of such programs. Such
    departments and agencies are directed to cooperate in such
    preparation and administration, on a reimbursable basis.
      (g) Nothing in this section authorizes the appropriation or
    expenditure of funds for (1) highway construction, maintenance, or
    design (other than design of safety features of highways to be
    incorporated into guidelines) or (2) any purpose for which funds
    are authorized by section 403 of this title.

      (i) Application in Indian Country. - 
        (1) Use of terms. - For the purpose of application of this
      section in Indian country, the terms "State" and "Governor of a
      State" include the Secretary of the Interior and the term
      "political subdivision of a State" includes an Indian tribe.
        (2) Expenditures for local highway programs. - Notwithstanding
      subsection (b)(1)(C), 95 percent of the funds apportioned to the
      Secretary of the Interior under this section shall be expended by

    rule promulgated in accordance with this section takes effect,
    States shall consider these highly effective programs when
    developing their highway safety programs.
      (k)(1) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the
    Secretary shall make a grant to any State which includes, as part

    motor vehicles, and roadways. Any such grant may only be used by
    such State to establish and maintain a comprehensive computerized
    traffic safety recordkeeping system or to obtain and operate
    components to support highway safety priority programs identified

    or survey.
      (2) No State may receive a grant under this subsection in more
    than two fiscal years.
      (3) The amount of the grant to any State under this subsection
    for the first fiscal year such State is eligible for a grant under
    this subsection shall equal 10 per centum of the amount apportioned
    to such State for fiscal year 1985 under this section. The amount
    of a grant to any State under this subsection for the second fiscal

    equal 10 per centum of the amount apportioned to such State for
    fiscal year 1986 under this section.
      (4) A State is eligible for a grant under this subsection if - 
        (A) it certifies to the Secretary that it has in operation a
      computerized traffic safety recordkeeping system and identifies
      proposed means of upgrading the system acceptable to the
      Secretary; or
        (B) it provides to the Secretary a plan acceptable to the
      Secretary for establishing and maintaining a computerized traffic
      safety recordkeeping system.

    authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section for the
    purpose of making grants under this subsection. Funds set aside
    under this subsection shall remain available for the fiscal year
    authorized and for the succeeding fiscal year and any amounts
    remaining unexpended at the end of such period shall be apportioned
    in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this
    section.
      (l) Law Enforcement Vehicular Pursuit Training. - A State shall
    actively encourage all relevant law enforcement agencies in such
    State to follow the guidelines established for vehicular pursuits
    issued by the International Association of Chiefs of Police that
    are in effect on the date of enactment of this subsection or as
    revised and in effect after such date as determined by the
    Secretary.
      (m) Consolidation of Grant Applications. - The Secretary shall
    establish an approval process by which a State may apply for all
    grants under this chapter for which a single application process
    with one annual deadline is appropriate. The Bureau of Indian
    Affairs shall establish a similar simplified process for
    applications for grants from Indian tribes under this chapter.

    deaths and injuries and to allow the Secretary to make
    determinations for use in developing programs to reduce such deaths
    and injuries and making recommendations to Congress concerning
    legislation necessary to implement such programs. The program shall

     AND REPORT; PUBLICATION OF LIST OF MOST EFFECTIVE SAFETY MEASURES
            IN FEDERAL REGISTER; SCHOOLBUS SAFETY GRANT PROGRAM
      Section 204 of Pub. L. 100-17 provided that:
      "(a) Study. - 
        "(1) National academy of sciences. - Not later than 30 days
      after the date of the enactment of this Act [Apr. 2, 1987], the
      Secretary shall undertake to enter into appropriate arrangements
      with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive
      study and investigation of the principal causes of fatalities and
      injuries to schoolchildren riding in schoolbuses and of the use
      of seatbelts in schoolbuses and other measures that may improve

            SPECIAL PARKING PRIVILEGES FOR HANDICAPPED PERSONS        
      Pub. L. 98-78, title III, Sec. 321, Aug. 15, 1983, 97 Stat. 473,
    provided that:
      "(a) The Congress finds that - 
        "(1) in this Nation there exist millions of handicapped people
      with severe physical impairments including partial paralysis,
      limb amputation, chronic heart condition, emphysema, arthritis,
      rheumatism, and other debilitating conditions which greatly limit
      their personal mobility;
        "(2) these people reside in each of the several States and have
      need and reason to travel from one State to another for business
      and recreational purposes;
        "(3) each State maintains the right to establish and enforce
      its own code of regulations regarding the appropriate use of
      motor vehicles operating within its jurisdiction;
        "(4) within a given State handicapped individuals are
      oftentimes granted special parking privileges to help offset the
      limitations imposed by their physical impairment;
        "(5) these special parking privileges vary from State to State
      as do the methods and means of identifying vehicles used by
      disabled individuals, all of which serve to impede both the
      enforcement of special parking privileges and the handicapped
      individual's freedom to properly utilize such privileges;
        "(6) there are many efforts currently underway to help
      alleviate these problems through public awareness and
      administrative change as encouraged by concerned individuals and
      national associations directly involved in matters relating to
      the issue of special parking privileges for disabled individuals;
      and
        "(7) despite these efforts the fact remains that many States
      may need to give the matter legislative consideration to ensure a
      proper resolution of this issue, especially as it relates to law
      enforcement and placard responsibility.
      "(b) The Congress encourages each of the several States working
    through the National Governors Conference to - 
        "(1) adopt the International Symbol of Access as the only
      recognized and adopted symbol to be used to identify vehicles
      carrying those citizens with acknowledged physical impairments;
        "(2) grant to vehicles displaying this symbol the special
      parking privileges which a State may provide; and
        "(3) permit the International Symbol of Access to appear either
      on a specialized license plate, or on a specialized placard
      placed in the vehicles so as to be clearly visible through the
      front windshield, or on both such places.
      "(c) It is the sense of the Congress that agreements of
    reciprocity relating to the special parking privileges granted
    handicapped individuals should be developed and entered into by and
    between the several States so as to - 
        "(1) facilitate the free and unencumbered use between the
      several States, of the special parking privileges afforded those
      people with acknowledged handicapped conditions, without regard
      to the State of residence of the handicapped person utilizing
      such privilege;
        "(2) improve the ease of law enforcement in each State of its
      special parking privileges and to facilitate the handling of
      violators; and
        "(3) ensure that motor vehicles carrying individuals with
      acknowledged handicapped conditions be given fair and predictable
      treatment throughout the Nation.
      "(d) As used in this section the term 'State' means the several
    States and the District of Columbia.
      "(e) The Secretary of Transportation shall provide a copy of this
    section to the Governor of each State and the Mayor of the District
    of Columbia."

      Section 210 of Pub. L. 95-599 provided that the Secretary of
    Transportation make a full and complete study of the effects of the
    provision contained in the eighth sentence of subsec. (c) of this
    section and that the Secretary report the results of such study to
    Congress not later than one year after Nov. 6, 1978.

    STUDY OF METHODS OF ENCOURAGING USE OF SAFETY BELTS IN AUTOMOBILES
      Section 214 of Pub. L. 95-599 provided that the Secretary of
    Transportation undertake to enter into arrangements with the
    National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study and investigation
    of methods of encouraging the use of safety belts by drivers of,
    and passengers in, motor vehicles and that the National Academy of
    Sciences report to the Secretary and the Congress not later than
    one year after Nov. 6, 1978, on the results of such study.

            EVALUATION OF SAFETY STANDARDS; REPORT TO CONGRESS        
      Section 208(b) of Pub. L. 94-280 provided that: "The Secretary of
    Transportation shall, in cooperation with the States, conduct an
    evaluation of the adequacy and appropriateness of all uniform
    safety standards established under section 402 of title 23 of the
    United States Code which are in effect on the date of enactment of
    this Act [May 5, 1976]. The Secretary shall report his findings,
    together with his recommendations, including but not limited to,
    the need for revision or consolidation of existing standards and
    the establishment of new standards, to Congress on or before July
    1, 1977. Until such report is submitted, the Secretary shall not,
    pursuant to subsection (c) of section 402 of title 23, United
    States Code, withhold any apportionment or any funds apportioned to
    any State because such State is failing to implement a highway
    safety program approved by the Secretary in accordance with such
    section 402."

         REPORT TO CONGRESS BY JULY 1, 1967, ON INITIAL STANDARDS     
      Section 203 of Pub. L. 89-564 required the Secretary of Commerce
    to report to Congress by July 1, 1967, all standards to be
    initially applied in carrying out section 402 of this title.

                      AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS                  
      Section 104 of Pub. L. 89-564 authorized the appropriation of
    $67,000,000, $100,000,000, and $100,000,000 for the fiscal years
    ending June 30, 1967, 1968, and 1969, respectively, to carry out

     EX. ORD. NO. 13513. FEDERAL LEADERSHIP ON REDUCING TEXT MESSAGING
                               WHILE DRIVING
      Ex. Ord. No. 13513, Oct. 1, 2009, 74 F.R. 51225, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including section
    7902(c) of title 5, United States Code, and the Federal Property
    and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 101
    et seq. [see Short Title of 1949 Act note set out under section 101
    of Title 41, Public Contracts], and in order to demonstrate Federal
    leadership in improving safety on our roads and highways and to
    enhance the efficiency of Federal contracting, it is hereby ordered
    as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. With nearly 3 million civilian employees, the
    Federal Government can and should demonstrate leadership in
    reducing the dangers of text messaging while driving. Recent deadly
    crashes involving drivers distracted by text messaging while behind
    the wheel highlight a growing danger on our roads. Text messaging
    causes drivers to take their eyes off the road and at least one
    hand off the steering wheel, endangering both themselves and
    others. Every day, Federal employees drive Government-owned,
    Government-leased, or Government-rented vehicles (collectively,
    GOV) or privately-owned vehicles (POV) on official Government
    business, and some Federal employees use Government-supplied
    electronic devices to text or e-mail while driving. A Federal
    Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while
    driving on official business or while using Government-supplied
    equipment will help save lives, reduce injuries, and set an example
    for State and local governments, private employers, and individual
    drivers. Extending this policy to cover Federal contractors is
    designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.
    Federal contractors and contractor employees who refrain from the
    unsafe practice of text messaging while driving in connection with
    Government business are less likely to experience disruptions to
    their operations that would adversely impact Federal procurement.
      Sec. 2. Text Messaging While Driving by Federal Employees.
    Federal employees shall not engage in text messaging (a) when
    driving GOV, or when driving POV while on official Government
    business, or (b) when using electronic equipment supplied by the
    Government while driving.
      Sec. 3. Scope of Order. (a) All agencies of the executive branch
    are directed to take appropriate action within the scope of their
    existing programs to further the policies of this order and to
    implement section 2 of this order. This includes, but is not
    limited to, considering new rules and programs, and reevaluating
    existing programs to prohibit text messaging while driving, and
    conducting education, awareness, and other outreach for Federal
    employees about the safety risks associated with texting while
    driving. These initiatives should encourage voluntary compliance
    with the agency's text messaging policy while off duty.

      purpose of determining whether the operators of the motor
      vehicles are driving while under the influence of alcohol - 
          (A) if the State organizes the campaigns in cooperation with
        related periodic national campaigns organized by the National
        Highway Traffic Safety Administration, except that this

    2175, as amended by Pub. L. 104-59, title III, Sec. 338(c)(1), Nov.
    28, 1995, 109 Stat. 604, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress finds that - 
        "(1) despite an annual expenditure in excess of $10,000,000,000
      on surface transportation and its infrastructure, the Federal
      Government has not developed a clear vision of - 
          "(A) how the surface transportation systems of the 21st
        century will differ from the present;
          "(B) how they will interface with each other and with other
        forms of transportation;
          "(C) how such systems will adjust to changing American
        population patterns and lifestyles; and
          "(D) the role of federally funded research and development in
        ensuring that appropriate transportation systems are developed
        and implemented;
        "(2) the population of the United States is projected to
      increase by over 30,000,000 people within the next 20 years,
      mostly in existing major metropolitan areas, which will result in
      increased traffic congestion within and between urban areas, more
      accidents, loss of productive time, and increased cost of
      transportation unless new technologies are developed to improve
      public transportation within cities and to move people and goods
      between cities;
        "(3) 18,000,000 crashes, 4,000,000 injuries, and 45,000
      fatalities each year on the Nation's highways are intolerable and
      substantial research is required in order to develop safer
      technologies in their most useful and economic forms;
        "(4) current research and development funding for surface
      transportation is insufficient to provide the United States with
      the technologies essential to providing its own advanced
      transportation systems in the future and, as a result, the United
      States is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign surface
      transportation technologies and equipment to meet its expanding
      surface transportation needs;
        "(5) a more active, focused surface transportation research and
      development program involving cooperation among the Federal
      Government, United States based industry, and United States
      universities should be organized on a priority basis;
        "(6) intelligent transportation systems represent the best near-
      term technology for improving surface transportation for public
      benefit by providing equipment which can improve traffic flow and
      provide for enhanced safety;
        "(7) research and development programs related to surface
      transportation are fragmented and dispersed throughout government
      and need to be strengthened and incorporated in an integrated
      framework within which a consensus on the goals of a national
      surface transportation research and development program must be
      developed;
        "(8) the inability of government agencies to cooperate
      effectively, the difficulty of obtaining public support for new
      systems and rights-of-way, and the high cost of capital financing
      discourage private firms from investing in the development of new
      transportation equipment and systems; therefore, the Federal
      Government should sponsor and coordinate research and development
      of new technologies to provide safer, more convenient, and
      affordable transportation systems for use in the future; and
        "(9) an effective high technology applied research and
      development program should be implemented quickly by
      strengthening the Department of Transportation research and
      development staff and by contracting with private industry for
      specific development projects.
      "(b) Surface Transportation Research and Development Plan. - 
        "(1) Development. - The Secretary shall develop an integrated
      national surface transportation research and development plan
      (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the 'plan').
        "(2) Focus. - The plan shall focus on surface transportation
      systems needed for urban, suburban, and rural areas in the next

        estimates, appropriate work scopes, personnel requirements, and
        estimated costs and goals for the next 3 years for each area of
        research and development.
          "(B) A 10-year projection of long-term programs in surface
        transportation research and development and recommendations for
        the appropriate source or mechanism for surface transportation
        research and development funding, taking into account
        recommendations of the Research and Development Coordinating
        Council of the Department of Transportation and the plan of the
        National Council on Surface Transportation Research.
          "(C) Recommendations on changes needed to assure that
        Federal, State, and local contracting procedures encourage the
        adoption of advanced technologies developed as a consequence of
        the research programs in this Act [Pub. L. 102-240, see Tables
        for classification].
        "(4) Objectives. - The plan shall provide for the following:

      is critical to the economic well-being, health, and welfare of
      the people of the United States;
        "(2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant
      programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure
      investment needs of the United States because of budgetary
      constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of
      government;
        "(3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that
      address critical national needs, such as intermodal facilities,
      border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, are of a scale
      that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State assistance
      programs in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [June 9,
      1998];
        "(4) new investment capital can be attracted to infrastructure
      projects that are capable of generating their own revenue streams
      through user charges or other dedicated funding sources; and
        "(5) a Federal credit program for projects of national
      significance can complement existing funding resources by filling
      market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private co-
      investment."

      percentage shall be adjusted by the Secretary to correspond with
      such lower non-Federal share;

      project that is undertaken by an entity that is not a State or
      local government or an agency or instrumentality of a State or

          covenant, to ensure repayment.
            (iii) The extent to which assistance under this chapter
          would foster innovative public-private partnerships and
          attract private debt or equity investment.
            (iv) The likelihood that assistance under this chapter

          including intelligent transportation systems, that enhance
          the efficiency of the project.

        subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary shall require each project
        applicant to provide a preliminary rating opinion letter from
        at least 1 rating agency indicating that the project's senior
        obligations, which may be the Federal credit instrument, have
        the potential to achieve an investment-grade rating.

      (c) Federal Requirements. - In addition to the requirements of
    this title for highway projects, chapter 53 of title 49 for transit
    projects, and section 5333(a) of title 49 for rail projects, the

    party have any right against the United States for payment solely
    by virtue of the contribution. Any security or debt-financing
    instrument issued by the infrastructure bank shall expressly state
    that the security or instrument does not constitute a commitment,
    guarantee, or obligation of the United States.
