    Sec. 112a. United States Treaties and Other International
      Agreements; contents; admissibility in evidence

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary of State shall cause to be compiled, edited,
    indexed, and published, beginning as of January 1, 1950, a
    compilation entitled "United States Treaties and Other
    International Agreements," which shall contain all treaties to
    which the United States is a party that have been proclaimed during
    each calendar year, and all international agreements other than
    treaties to which the United States is a party that have been
    signed, proclaimed, or with reference to which any other final
    formality has been executed, during each calendar year. The said
    United States Treaties and Other International Agreements shall be
    legal evidence of the treaties, international agreements other than
    treaties, and proclamations by the President of such treaties and
    agreements, therein contained, in all the courts of the United
    States, the several States, and the Territories and insular
    possessions of the United States.
      (b) The Secretary of State may determine that publication of
    certain categories of agreements is not required, if the following
    criteria are met:
        (1) such agreements are not treaties which have been brought
      into force for the United States after having received Senate
      advice and consent pursuant to section 2(2) of Article II of the
      Constitution of the United States;
        (2) the public interest in such agreements is insufficient to
      justify their publication, because (A) as of the date of
      enactment of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal
      Years 1994 and 1995, the agreements are no longer in force,(!1)
      (B) the agreements do not create private rights or duties, or
      establish standards intended to govern government action in the
      treatment of private individuals; (C) in view of the limited or
      specialized nature of the public interest in such agreements,
      such interest can adequately be satisfied by an alternative
      means; or (D) the public disclosure of the text of the agreement
      would, in the opinion of the President, be prejudicial to the
      national security of the United States; and

        (3) copies of such agreements (other than those in paragraph
      (2)(D)), including certified copies where necessary for
      litigation or similar purposes, will be made available by the
      Department of State upon request.

      (c) Any determination pursuant to subsection (b) shall be
    published in the Federal Register.
      (d) The Secretary of State shall make publicly available through
    the Internet website of the Department of State each treaty or
    international agreement proposed to be published in the compilation
    entitled "United States Treaties and Other International
    Agreements" not later than 180 days after the date on which the
    treaty or agreement enters into force.

    Sec. 112b. United States international agreements; transmission to
      Congress

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary of State shall transmit to the Congress the
    text of any international agreement (including the text of any oral
    international agreement, which agreement shall be reduced to
    writing), other than a treaty, to which the United States is a
    party as soon as practicable after such agreement has entered into
    force with respect to the United States but in no event later than
    sixty days thereafter. However, any such agreement the immediate
    public disclosure of which would, in the opinion of the President,
    be prejudicial to the national security of the United States shall
    not be so transmitted to the Congress but shall be transmitted to
    the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee
    on International Relations of the House of Representatives under an
    appropriate injunction of secrecy to be removed only upon due
    notice from the President. Any department or agency of the United
    States Government which enters into any international agreement on
    behalf of the United States shall transmit to the Department of
    State the text of such agreement not later than twenty days after
    such agreement has been signed.
      (b) Not later than March 1, 1979, and at yearly intervals
    thereafter, the President shall, under his own signature, transmit
    to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of
    the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report with
    respect to each international agreement which, during the preceding
    year, was transmitted to the Congress after the expiration of the
    60-day period referred to in the first sentence of subsection (a),
    describing fully and completely the reasons for the late
    transmittal.
      (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an international
    agreement may not be signed or otherwise concluded on behalf of the
    United States without prior consultation with the Secretary of
    State. Such consultation may encompass a class of agreements rather
    than a particular agreement.
      (d)(1) The Secretary of State shall annually submit to Congress a
    report that contains an index of all international agreements,
    listed by country, date, title, and summary of each such agreement
    (including a description of the duration of activities under the
    agreement and the agreement itself), that the United States - 
        (A) has signed, proclaimed, or with reference to which any
      other final formality has been executed, or that has been
      extended or otherwise modified, during the preceding calendar
      year; and
        (B) has not been published, or is not proposed to be published,
