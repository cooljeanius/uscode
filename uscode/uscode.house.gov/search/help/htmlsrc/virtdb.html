<H1>Virtual Database: Searching Multiple Databases</H1>
<HR>
With PLWeb Turbo, you can have multiple databases open simultaneously; this is known as a <I>virtual database</I>. With a virtual 
database, you are able to search across several databases with a single query.
<P>
The following list summarizes PLWeb Turbo's performance characteristics that are affected by virtual database searching.

<UL>
<LI>One disadvantage of a virtual database is that searches may be slightly slower than when conducted against a single 
database.
<LI>A <A HREF="consrch.html">concept</A> search will find related words from all open databases.
<LI>Hit records retrieved from all open databases are combined into a single ranked <A HREF="resscrn.html#xhitlist">Hitlist</A>.
<LI>The <A HREF="reladv.html">Relate</A> Screen will display a merged list of related words from all open databases.
<LI>The <A HREF="dicadv.html">Dictionary</A> Screen will display a merged dictionary for all open databases.
<LI>The <A HREF="fuzadv.html">Fuzzy</A> Match Screen will display a merged list of similarly spelled words from all open databases.
