<H1>What is an Advisor?</H1>
<HR>
PLWeb Turbo features tools called <I>advisors</I>, which serve as online assistants. As part of the <A HREF="advtool.html#xfeedback">feedback</A> searching process, you 
can use the advisors to gain added insight into the nature of a database's contents. In addition, you can use advisor 
results to refine your current query.
<P>
The <A HREF="reladv.html">Relate</A> Advisor can suggest appropriate search terms that you might never have considered. It produces a list of 
words that, in the context of the database, are related to the words in your current query.
<P>
The <A HREF="dicadv.html">Dictionary</A> Advisor can verify the existence of a query word and/or its variants within a database. With this 
advisor, you can decide if a word might yield good results, or if it should be excluded.
<P>
The <A HREF="fuzadv.html">Fuzzy</A> Match Advisor scans the database for words with spelling similar to that of a query term. It can identify 
correct spelling--if you're in doubt about yours--and instances where scanned material has been incorrectly 
interpreted during OCR (optical character recognition) processing.
