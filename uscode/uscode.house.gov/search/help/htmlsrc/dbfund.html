<H2>Databases, Records, and <A NAME="xfields">Fields</A></H2>
A text <I>database</I> is a collection of related documents assembled into a single searchable unit. The individual documents 
can be massive or minuscule, but they should bear some relation to each other.
<P>
A database is composed of smaller units called <I>records</I>. In a text database, a record can be an entire document, a 
section within a document, a single page, or a fragment of text within a page. When you search a database, you will 
retrieve one or more records containing information that satisfies your query.
<P>
A record can contain smaller regions of data called <I>fields</I>. A field usually defines a particular type of data common to 
several or all records within a database. For instance, in a database of corporate memos, wherein each memo makes up 
a record, the following fields might be used: <I>TO, FROM, DATE, SUBJECT,</I> and <I>TEXT</I>. You can narrow the scope of a 
search by <A HREF="fld1op.html">restricting</A> it to one or more fields. In this example, you might limit your search to the <I>FROM</I> field when 
searching for a sender's name. Only those records with the specified name in that field would be retrieved.

<H2><A NAME="xstopwords">Stopwords</A></H2>
As opposed to a keyword-based system, PLWeb Turbo is full-text retrieval software, meaning that it indexes every word in a 
document, with the exception of <I>stopwords</I>. Stopwords are those terms that PLWeb Turbo is programmed to ignore during the 
indexing and retrieval processes, in order to prevent the retrieval of extraneous records. Generally, a stopword list 
includes articles, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions (<I>the, they, very, not, of,</I> etc.) that are most common in 
the English language. After reading about <A HREF="relrank.html">relevance</A> ranking, you'll understand why a stopword list is used.
