<HR>
The Dictionary Advisor is useful for verifying the existence of words within a database; if a search for a particular 
word yields no hits, and you believe that the word is in the database, the Dictionary Advisor can confirm or deny your 
suspicions. This advisor also shows what variants of a given word exist in a database.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Note:	The Dictionary Advisor will act on the first word in a multi-word query.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The Dictionary Screen will display an excerpt of entries from the <I>dictionary</I>, an alphabetical listing of all unique terms 
in the active database(s), with the exception of <A HREF="dbfund.html#xstopwords">stopwords</A>.
The displayed excerpt begins at the point in the dictionary where the first word in your query does, or would, appear.

Query button. You can select multiple words for inclusion by control-clicking on them.

After clicking on the Add Words to Query button, you will see your selection(s) appended to your current query.
