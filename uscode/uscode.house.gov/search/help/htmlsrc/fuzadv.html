<H1>Fuzzy Matching: Identifying Words with Similar Spelling</H1>
<HR>
The Fuzzy Match Advisor can be helpful in finding word variants or misspellings in a database--the result of 
typographical mistakes or errors during OCR (optical character recognition) processing. Also, if you have doubts about 
the spelling of a query word, you can use the Fuzzy Match Advisor to verify it.
<P>
After entering a query word in the Search Screen, you can activate the Fuzzy Match Advisor by clicking on its radio 
button and clicking on the Get Results button.
