      <P>From the mid 19th century to the present, a substantial amount of Federal legislation related to voting and elections has been enacted (see, e.g., Act of July 25, 1866 (14 Stat. 243); Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-110, 79 Stat. 437); Help America Vote Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-252, 116 Stat. 1666)).

<P>In 1926, when the original organizational scheme for the United States Code was established, there were still a fairly limited number of provisions related to voting and elections, and no distinct title for voting and elections was created at that time. As this body of statutory material grew over the decades, much of it was incorporated into the United States Code in title 42 (The Public Health and Welfare). Other provisions related to voting and elections were incorporated into the United States Code in title 2 (The Congress), title 3 (The President), title 26 (Internal Revenue Code), and title 48 (Territories and Insular Possessions).

<P>The bill gathers provisions related to voting and elections and restates these provisions as a new positive law title of the United States Code. The new positive law title replaces the former provisions, which are repealed by the bill.

<P>The bill was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as part of the Office's ongoing responsibility under section 205(c) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93-554 (2 U.S.C. 285b), ``[t]o prepare, and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary one title at a time, a complete compilation, restatement, and revision of the general and permanent laws of the United States''.


<P>All changes in existing law made by the bill are purely technical in nature. The bill was prepared in accordance with the statutory standard for codification legislation, which is that the restatement of existing law shall conform to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of the Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections.

<P>The bill was delivered to the Committee on the Judiciary on February 27, 2009. The bill has not yet been introduced.
