<p>H.R. 1107 would enact certain laws relating to public contracts as title 41, United States Code, ``Public Contracts''.

<p>H.R. 1107 revises and restates certain laws relating to public contracts and re-enacts those laws as title 41, United States Code.  The bill was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives, as part of its responsibility under 2 U.S.C. 285b to submit to the Committee on the Judiciary proposed bills to enact titles of the United States Code into positive law.

<p>This bill has undergone extensive review over several Congresses.  Predecessor bills to H.R. 1107 were introduced in the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses -- H.R. 4320 in the 108th, H.R. 5414 in the 109th, and H.R. 4779 in the 110th.  H.R. 4779 was ordered favorably reported by the Committee on July 30, 2008.

<p>When H.R. 4779 was introduced, on  December 18, 2007, Chairman Conyers placed an introductory statement in the Congressional Record inviting interested parties to review the bill and submit comments to the Law Revision Counsel. A number of comments were received, and the bill as ordered reported incorporated a number of revisions made in light of those comments.

<p>H.R. 1107 was introduced February 23, 2009, by Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith. H.R. 1107 incorporates changes based on laws enacted during the 110th Congress. In addition, H.R. 1107 incorporates a number of revisions made in light of supplemental comments that were submitted to the Committee after the predecessor bill, H.R. 4779, had already been ordered reported. H.R. 1107 was ordered favorably reported by the Committee on March 18, 2009, and was passed by the House on May 6, 2009. H.R. 1107 was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 7, 2009. H.R. 1107 with amendments was passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on December 2, 2010. A message on the Senate action was sent to the House on December 3, 2010. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on December 17, 2010. H.R. 1107 was signed by the President on January 4, 2011, and became Public Law 111-350.
