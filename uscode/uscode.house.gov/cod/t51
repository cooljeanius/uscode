<P>Public Law 111-314 revises and restates certain laws relating to national and commercial space programs as a new positive law title of the United States Code.</P>

<P>The bill to enact this legislation was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as part of its ongoing responsibility under section 205(c) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93-544 (2  U.S.C.  285b), to prepare, and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary one title at a time, a complete compilation, restatement, and revision of the general and permanent laws of the United States.</P>

<P>Over the past five decades, a substantial amount of legislation was enacted relating to national and commercial space programs. In the United States Code, some of these provisions appeared in title 15 (Commerce and Trade), some in title 42 (The Public Health and Welfare), and some in title 49 (Transportation). No distinct title for national and commercial space programs existed in the United States Code because the organizational scheme for the Code was originally established in 1926, before such programs were contemplated.</P>

<P>Public Law 111-314 gathers provisions relating to national and commercial space programs, and restates the provisions as title 51, United States Code, ``National and Commercial Space Programs''. Public Law 111-314 does not provide for any new programs. Nor does it modify or repeal any existing programs. Rather, the Act restates existing law in a manner adhering to the policy, intent, and purpose of the original enactments, while improving the organizational structure of the law and removing ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections.</P>
