<p>
The bill revises and restates the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.), the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), and related provisions of other Acts as a new positive law title, Title 53, Small Business, of the United States Code.

The bill was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as part of the Office's ongoing responsibility under section 205(c) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress, as enacted into law by Public Law 93-544 (2  U.S.C.  285b), to prepare and submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, one title at a time, a complete compilation, restatement, and revision of the general and permanent laws of the United States.

The bill is a successor to H.R. 1983, which was introduced in the 111th Congress by Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, Jr., with Ranking Member Lamar Smith as cosponsor. The bill contains changes made in response to comments received on H.R. 1983 and changes to incorporate legislation in the 111th Congress and the 112th Congress. The bill also has been revised to follow the improved section designation system and typographical format that the Office has adopted for future positive law titles of the Code.
