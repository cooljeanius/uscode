    United States, related to definitions and maritime commercial
    instruments and liens, are revised, consolidated, and enacted by
    paragraph (3) of this subsection [probably means subsection (c) of
    this section] as subtitle III of title 46, United States Code,
    'Shipping'."
      Pub. L. 98-89, Sec. 1, Aug. 26, 1983, 97 Stat. 500, provided in
    part that: "Certain general and permanent laws of the United
    States, related to vessels and seamen, are revised, consolidated,
    and enacted as title 46, United States Code, 'Shipping' ".

                   LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND CONSTRUCTION               
      Pub. L. 109-304, Sec. 2, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1485, provided
    that:
      "(a) Purpose. - The purpose of this Act [see Tables for
    classification] is to complete the codification of title 46, United
    States Code, "Shipping", as positive law, by reorganizing and
    restating the laws currently in the appendix to title 46.
      "(b) Conformity With Original Intent. - In the codification of
    laws by this Act, the intent is to conform to the understood
    policy, intent, and purpose of the Congress in the original
    enactments, with such amendments and corrections as will remove
    ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, in accordance
    with section 205(c)(1) of House Resolution No. 988, 93d Congress,
    as enacted into law by Public Law 93-554 (2 U.S.C. 285b(1))."
      Pub. L. 109-304, Sec. 18, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1709, provided
    that:
      "(a) Cutoff Date. - This Act [see Tables for classification]
    replaces certain provisions enacted on or before April 30, 2005. If
    a law enacted after that date amends or repeals a provision
    replaced by this Act, that law is deemed to amend or repeal, as the
    case may be, the corresponding provision enacted by this Act. If a
    law enacted after that date is otherwise inconsistent with this
    Act, it supersedes this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.
      "(b) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged. - For purposes of
    determining whether one provision supersedes another based on
    enactment later in time, the date of enactment of a provision
    enacted by this Act is deemed to be the date of enactment of the
    provision it replaced.
      "(c) References to Provisions Replaced. - A reference to a
    provision replaced by this Act is deemed to refer to the
    corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
      "(d) Laws Governing Applicability of Prior Amendments. - This Act
    does not affect any law governing the applicability of an amendment
    to a provision replaced by this Act, notwithstanding the repeal by
    this Act of the provision that was amended. To the extent that any
    such law governed the applicability of a provision replaced by this
    Act, that law governs the applicability of the corresponding
    provision enacted by this Act.
      "(e) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative Actions. - A
    regulation, order, or other administrative action in effect under a
    provision replaced by this Act continues in effect under the
    corresponding provision enacted by this Act.
      "(f) Actions Taken and Offenses Committed. - An action taken or
    an offense committed under a provision replaced by this Act is
    deemed to have been taken or committed under the corresponding
    provision enacted by this Act."

      "(a) A reference to a law replaced by section 102 of this Act
    [see Tables for classification], including a reference in a
    regulation, order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the
    corresponding provision of this Act.
      "(b) An order, rule, or regulation in effect under a law replaced
    by section 102 of this Act continues in effect under the
    corresponding provision of this Act until repealed, amended, or
    superseded.
      "(c) An action taken or an offense committed under a law replaced
    by section 102 of this Act is deemed to have been taken or
    committed under the corresponding provision of this Act.
      "(d) An inference of legislative construction is not to be drawn
    by reason of the caption or catch line of a provision enacted by
    section 102 of this Act.
      "(e) If a provision of this Act is held invalid, all valid
    provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in
    effect. If a provision of this Act is held invalid in any of its
    applications, the provision remains valid for all valid
    applications that are severable from any of the invalid
    applications."

      The words "when used in reference to a natural person" are added
    because of provisions in the title which treat entities as
    citizens. The words "or an individual citizen of the Trust
    Territory of the Pacific Islands who is exclusively domiciled in
    the Northern Mariana Islands within the meaning of section 1005(e)
    of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
    Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (48
    U.S.C. 1801 note)" are omitted because the Covenant referred to
    became effective November 4, 1986, making citizens of the Northern
    Mariana Islands citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United
    States.

    Code and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (b)(2), the words "The term of each Commissioner is

    Sec. 304. Delegation of authority

-STATUTE-
      (a) Delegation. - The Federal Maritime Commission, by published
    order or regulation, may delegate to a division of the Commission,
    an individual Commissioner, an employee board, or an officer or
    employee of the Commission, any of its duties or powers, including
    those relating to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying,
    reporting, or otherwise acting on any matter. This subsection does
    not affect section 556(b) of title 5.
      (b) Review. - The Commission may review any action taken under a
    delegation of authority under subsection (a). The review may be
    taken on the Commission's own initiative or on the petition of a
    party to or an intervenor in the action, within the time and in the
    manner prescribed by the Commission. The vote of a majority of the
    Commission, less one member, is sufficient to bring an action
    before the Commission for review.
      (c) Deemed Action of Commission. - If the Commission declines
    review, or if review is not sought, within the time prescribed
    under subsection (b), the action taken under the delegation of
    authority is deemed to be the action of the Commission.

      This section replaces 46 U.S.C. 2108, which was enacted as part
    of the codification of subtitle II of title 46 in 1983. That
    provision was based on section 26 of the Act of June 26, 1884, ch.
    121, 23 Stat. 59, which prior to the subtitle II codification
    appeared at 46 U.S.C. 8 (1982 ed.). In the enactment of 46 U.S.C.
    2108, the scope of the 1884 provision was narrowed, presumably
    inadvertently. This section restores the remissions authority to
    its prior scope. Note that 19 C.F.R. Sec. 4.24 (2003) still refers
    to "the authority to make refunds in accordance with section 26 of
    the Act of June 26, 1884 (46 U.S.C. 8)" as if that provision had
    not been replaced by 46 U.S.C. 2108 in 1983.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 2101(1) defines the type of "associated equipment" that
    is involved in the use of recreational boats that are subject to
    Federal regulatory authority. This equipment is subject to a number
    of controls under federally established construction and
    performance standards. Radio equipment is exempt from these
    regulatory controls, since this equipment continues to be regulated
    by the Federal Communications Commission.
      Section 2101(2) defines "barge" as a vessel that is non-self-
    propelled and that is often pushed ahead, towed alongside, or
    towed astern on a hawser by a towing vessel. It does not include a
    vessel that is propelled by sail only.
      Section 2101(3) defines "boundary line" for the establishment of
    jurisdictional parameters for various maritime safety laws. Public
    Law 96-324, codified at 33 U.S.C. 151, permits the Secretary to
    establish appropriate identifiable lines dividing inland waters of
    the U.S. from the high seas for the purpose of determining the
    applicability of these laws. These laws will now be included within
    subtitle II of title 46 - Shipping. These lines may not be located
    more than twelve nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which
    the territorial sea is measured and may differ in position for the
    purposes of different parts or sections of subtitle II.
      Section 2101(4) defines "Coast Guard".
      Section 2101(5) provides that wherever the term "commercial
    service" is used it is to include all vessels except those that are
    primarily used for combatant purposes. This is to make sure that
    vessels that are engaged in the transportation of goods or
    individuals are subject to the applicable maritime and
    environmental safety laws, even if they are sovereign controlled
    vessels.
      Section 2101(6) defines "consular officer" as one who has
    authority to issue visas. Traditionally this person is
    knowledgeable and familiar with the maritime safety and seamen's
    welfare laws.
      Section 2101(7) defines "crude oil" because certain equipment
    requirements like inert gas systems, segregated ballast tanks,
    crude oil washing systems or special ballast arrangements are
    applicable only to tank vessels that carry crude oil. Crude oil is
    still included within the definition of "hazardous material" and
    "oil".
      Section 2101(8) defines a "crude oil tanker" as one engaged in
    carrying crude oil. The definition does not include a tank barge
    since a tanker is defined as a self-propelled tank vessel. See also
    2101(38).
      Section 2101(9) makes it clear that the term "discharge" when
    referring to a substance that emanates from a vessel and is related
    to the marine environmental laws concerning pollution by oil or
    hazardous substances.
      Section 2101(10) defines a "documented vessel" as any vessel of
    the United States that has been issued a certificate of
    documentation that might include a register, enrollment, license,
    or enrollment and license for various trades.
      Section 2101(11) lists what is included in the term "fisheries"
    for the purpose of documentation of vessels and is intended to be
    all-inclusive of the numerous types of fishing activities.
      Section 2101(12) defines "foreign vessel" as any foreign flag or
    foreign operated vessel that is operated under the jurisdiction or
    authority of a government other than the United States.
      Section 2101(13) defines a "freight vessel" as a motor vessel or
    any vessel propelled by diesel or other internal combustion engines
    and that carries freight for hire.
      Section 2101(14) defines "hazardous materials" as a broad range
    of materials that are not only flammable or combustible but are
    also designated under related maritime safety and environmental
    laws.
      Section 2101(15) defines "marine environment" as an all-inclusive
    term that was developed to cover land and water areas that could be
    affected by pollution from all vessels and not only tank vessels.
      Section 2101(16) defines "motor vessel" as a vessel propelled by
    machinery other than steam to make it clear that these vessels are
    not steam vessels.
      Section 2101(17) defines "nautical school vessel" as a vessel
    that can be a privately owned and operated as well as a publicly
    owned and operated school vessel.
      Section 2101(18) defines "oceanographic research vessel" as a
    vessel employed in oceanography or limnology research or
    instruction. It is defined because this type of vessel, while not
    inspected and certified as such, is subject to a number of special
    statutory and regulatory requirements.
      Section 2101(19) defines "offshore supply vessel" as a class of
    vessel that is limited by tonnage and its employment in the mineral
    and oil industry and while so employed it is not a small passenger
    vessel.
      Section 2101(20) defines "oil" to include oil of any type, in any
    form, or in any mixture. This is the definition that originated
    with marine environment and pollution laws and continues the
    definition that was adopted by port and tanker safety laws.
      Section 2101(21) defines the term "passengers" in relation to
    various types of vessels. Due to the complexity of existing laws
    with respect to the definitions of "passenger" on various
    categories of vessels and the need to not make any changes of a
    substantive nature that could be construed as controversial, four
    definitions of "passenger" have been included.
      Section 2101(22) defines "passenger vessel" as one that is at
    least 100 gross tons and carries at least one passenger for hire.
      Section 2101(23) defines "product carrier" as a tanker that is
    engaged in carrying oil. This definition when read with the
    definition of tanker means that it is a self-propelled vessel. A
    tank barge carrying oil products is a tank vessel but is not
    subject to the special standards or requirements for a product
    carrier.
      Section 2101(24) defines a "public vessel" as a governmental
    vessel that is not in commercial service. It should be noted that a
    sovereign-controlled foreign-flag vessel that is engaged in
    commercial service is not a public vessel and is subject to
    maritime safety and environment laws.
      Section 2101(25) defines a "recreational vessel" as a class of
    vessel whose primary purpose is for pleasure. These vessels while
    not subject to inspection are subject to certain requirements of
    law to improve boating safety.
      Section 2101(26) defines a "recreational vessel manufacturer" as
    one that is involved with not only the recreational vessels
    themselves but also with their components or associated equipment.
      Section 2101(27), (28), (29), and (30) provides a number of
    definitions that define the type of instruction, instructor,
    student, and vessel that is involved in the teaching of sailing.
      Section 2101(31) defines "scientific personnel" as individuals
    engaged in oceanography or limnology because they are specially
    treated under various maritime safety requirements.
      Section 2101(32) defines a "seagoing barge" as a vessel that is
    at least 100 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary
    line.
      Section 2101(33) defines a "seagoing motor vessel" as a vessel
    that must be a motor vessel, as defined in 2101(15), of at least
    300 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary line.
      Section 2101(34) defines "Secretary" so that maritime safety and
    seamen's welfare jurisdiction remains within the Coast Guard at all
    times.
      Section 2101(35) defines "small passenger vessel" as one that is
    less than 100 gross tons carrying more than six passengers as
    defined in section 2101(21).
      Section 2101(36) defines "State" as a State, territory or
    possession of the United States and is used to establish
    jurisdictional limits for the application of the various maritime
    safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This
    definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that
    relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement
    programs.
      Section 2101(37) defines a "steam vessel" as a vessel propelled
    by steam. However, steam vessels of not more than 40 feet that are
    used exclusively for pleasure are not included.
      Section 2101(38) defines "tanker" as a self-propelled tank vessel
    that has been constructed or primarily adapted to carry oil or
    hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces. This vessel is a
    subclass of tank vessel, which is defined in section 2101(39). This
    subclass definition is necessary because certain statutory minimum
    requirements that are consistent with internationally accepted
    standards are solely applicable to these vessels.
      Section 2101(39) defines a "tank vessel" as a vessel carrying oil
    or hazardous materials in bulk or residue including a tanker as
    defined in section 2101(38).
      Section 2101(40) defines "towing vessel" as a vessel in
    commercial service that pushes, pulls, or tows alongside and
    includes what is traditionally known as a tug.
      Section 2101(41) defines "undocumented" which, in part,
    facilitates the classification of vessels that may be numbered by
    the proper issuing authority in a State.
      Section 2101(42) defines an "uninspected passenger vessel" as a
    vessel carrying six or less passengers.
      Section 2101(43) defines an "uninspected vessel" as a vessel not
    subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard under
    section 3301. Recreational vessels and inland towing vessels are
    typical uninspected vessels.
      Section 2101(44) defines "United States" to establish
    geographical boundaries for the applicability of the various
    maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle.
    This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102
    that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement
    programs.
      Section 2101(45) makes it clear that "vessel" as used in this
    subtitle has the same meaning as is provided in section 3 of title
    1, of the U.S.C.
      Section 2101(46) defines "vessel of the United States" as a
    vessel that is documented or numbered under the laws of the United
    States. A documented vessel and those vessels that are numbered by
    a State or Federal authority are afforded the protection of the

      Section 2107 provides for standard procedures for the handling of
    civil penalties for infractions of law or regulation. Some changes
    were made to increase some antiquated and inadequate penalties.
      The assessment of civil penalties under this section should not
    require an "on the record" hearing within the meaning of the
    Administrative Procedures Act (APA). It is intended that these
    civil penalties be assessed in a fair manner. However, the
    Committee recognizes that statutes passed in the last decade have
    involved the Coast Guard in tens of thousands of civil penalty
    enforcement cases and that it is necessary that the penalties be
    assessed efficiently. The Coast Guard's procedural regulations for
    assessing civil penalties ensure that the essential elements of due
    process, notice, and opportunity to be heard, are provided to
    alleged violators (see 33 CFR Subpart 1.07). The more rigid and
    time-consuming procedures applicable to APA adjudications are
    unwarranted in the case of Coast Guard civil penalty assessment
    procedures and would seriously hamper the orderly enforcement of
    these administrative penalties.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2006 - Pub. L. 109-241 substituted "this subtitle or subtitle
    VII" for "this subtitle" in two places in subsec. (a) and in one

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2114. Protection of seamen against discrimination

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) A person may not discharge or in any manner discriminate
    against a seaman because - 
        (A) the seaman in good faith has reported or is about to report
      to the Coast Guard or other appropriate Federal agency or
      department that the seaman believes that a violation of a
      maritime safety law or regulation prescribed under that law or
      regulation has occurred;
        (B) the seaman has refused to perform duties ordered by the
      seaman's employer because the seaman has a reasonable
      apprehension or expectation that performing such duties would
      result in serious injury to the seaman, other seamen, or the
      public;
        (C) the seaman testified in a proceeding brought to enforce a
      maritime safety law or regulation prescribed under that law;
        (D) the seaman notified, or attempted to notify, the vessel
      owner or the Secretary of a work-related personal injury or work-
      related illness of a seaman;
        (E) the seaman cooperated with a safety investigation by the
      Secretary or the National Transportation Safety Board;
        (F) the seaman furnished information to the Secretary, the
      National Transportation Safety Board, or any other public
      official as to the facts relating to any marine casualty
      resulting in injury or death to an individual or damage to
      property occurring in connection with vessel transportation; or
        (G) the seaman accurately reported hours of duty under this
      part.

      (2) The circumstances causing a seaman's apprehension of serious
    injury under paragraph (1)(B) must be of such a nature that a
    reasonable person, under similar circumstances, would conclude that
    there is a real danger of an injury or serious impairment of health
    resulting from the performance of duties as ordered by the seaman's
    employer.
      (3) To qualify for protection against the seaman's employer under
    paragraph (1)(B), the employee must have sought from the employer,
    and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.
      (b) A seaman alleging discharge or discrimination in violation of
    subsection (a) of this section, or another person at the seaman's
    request, may file a complaint with respect to such allegation in
    the same manner as a complaint may be filed under subsection (b) of
    section 31105 of title 49. Such complaint shall be subject to the
    procedures, requirements, and rights described in that section,
    including with respect to the right to file an objection, the right

      Section 2302 states that the negligent operation of a vessel is
    prohibited. These acts are subject to civil and criminal penalties
    and the involved vessel is subject to an in rem action. The
    negligent operation provisions have their genesis in the Act of
    April 25, 1940, 54 Stat. 167, when Congress prescribed that no
    person shall operate any motorboat or any vessel in a reckless or
    negligent manner. This provision was directed at all vessels and
    not those solely engaged in recreational boating. When the Federal
    Boat Safety Act of 1971, P.L. 92-75, 85 Stat. 217 (46 U.S.C. 1461)
    was enacted it adopted the reckless or negligent operation
    provisions of the 1940 Act. It adopted for the first time a
    provision for assessing civil penalties in addition to criminal
    penalties. It dropped the word "reckless" because of redundancy. It
    also combined the two classes of vessels; "any motorboat or any
    vessel" into one class by using the word "vessel" and defined
    vessel as including every description of watercraft.

        (A) notify the Coast Guard; and
        (B) use all available means to determine the status of the
      vessel.

      (3) A person notifying the Coast Guard under paragraph (1) or (2)
    of this subsection shall provide the name and identification number
    of the vessel, the names of individuals on board, and other
    information that may be requested by the Coast Guard. The owner,

    and regulation of vessels by the Coast Guard. This part specifies
    those vessels subject to inspection, those that are specifically
    exempt from inspection, and related inspection requirements and
    procedures. Due to the need for special requirements for the
    inspection and regulation of passenger vessels and those vessels
    carrying liquid bulk dangerous cargoes separate chapters have been
    developed. Additional chapters provide for recreational vessels and
    those other vessels that are regulated but are not subject to
    inspection and certification by the Coast Guard. It should also be
    noted that the United States is signatory to a number of
    international treaties on maritime safety and seamen's welfare,
    such as the various Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaties, and
    that their provisions and requirements are part of United States
    maritime law and in many cases are quite extensive.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Chapter 33 consolidates the laws governing the inspection and
    certification of vessels by the Coast Guard that have developed
    over a period in excess of 140 years. The original laws were
    directed to the safety of the relatively new and potentially
    dangerous steam vessel. The demand for Federal remedial legislation
    began during the early 1800's after frequent and disastrous
    explosions of steam boilers on passenger vessels. This directly led
    to the first maritime safety laws in 1838 that required periodic
    inspection and certification of vessels engaged in the
    transportation of passengers and freight on the waters of the
    United States. This was followed by a more extensive steamboat
    inspection law in 1852 which adopted for the first time the
    principle of licensing for river pilots and engineers. It also
    created a new Federal maritime safety inspection service called the
    Federal Inspection Service that eventually became the Bureau of
    Marine Inspection and Navigation, whose duties were temporarily
    assumed in 1941 and permanently assumed in 1946 by the United
    States Coast Guard.
      In 1864 the principal inspection and licensing provisions of the
    1852 act were made applicable to ferries, towing vessels, and canal
    boats. However, steamboat explosions continued with high loss of
    life and property. One of the greatest of all disasters, the
    destruction of the passenger vessel Sultana by explosion and fire
    with a loss of life estimated at more than 1500 lives in April
    1865, led to renewed legislation efforts. In 1871 this culminated
    with legislation that combined a number of new requirements into a
    coherent and unified body of maritime safety laws. At the time of
    the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1874, a maritime safety
    code was well established for vessels propelled in whole or in part
    by steam.
      In the more than 100 years since then, as the public recognized
    the need for vessel safety legislation, primarily as the result of
    maritime disasters, other classes of vessels were subjected to
    Federal inspection or regulatory control. These included vessels
    propelled by gas, fluid, naphtha, or electric motors in 1897; sail
    vessels and barges carrying passengers for hire in 1898; seagoing
    barges in 1908; motorboats in 1910; steam vessels owned by the
    Department of Commerce in 1919; seagoing vessels of 300 gross tons
    and over on June 20, 1936; all tank vessels carrying flammable or
    combustible liquid cargo in bulk regardless of size or means of
    propulsion of June 23, 1936; motorboats again in 1940; all vessels
    carrying more than six passengers in 1956; tank vessels again in
    1978; and offshore supply vessels in 1980. There was also
    considerable legislation that amended or supplemented these primary
    maritime safety laws.
      The net result has been a patchwork quilt of categories and
    classifications that requires a tabulation of more than seventy
    different classes of inspected vessels. This revision gathers into
    one section of the law all classes of vessels that are subject to
    inspection and certification without changing the application of
    present law as to any one class of vessel. The revision does not
    alter the application of the present law so as to expand inspection
    requirements to any vessel presently not subject to inspection nor
    to remove from inspection any vessel that is presently subject to
    inspection.

      Section 3301 lists all classes of vessels that are subject to
    inspection and certification by the Coast Guard. This section
    represents one of the sought-after advantages of the bill to
    simplify access to the provisions of law governing the regulation
    of vessels. Under the present law, a vessel's inspection status
    must be determined by examining a table appearing at section 2.01-
    7A of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations that divides all
    vessels into more than 70 separate classes.
      It is important to note that while the classes of vessels are now
    limited to ten, there is no prohibition against developing
    regulations to meet the special needs of various size vessels
    within any one category. For example, it is expected that the Coast
    Guard will continue the practice of establishing standards for
    freight vessels of not more than 100 gross tons and other standards
    for larger freight vessels.
      It should also be noted that a particular vessel can, when
    engaged in various types of operations, be subject to varying
    inspection laws. For example, an offshore supply vessel could be
    classed as a small passenger vessel or a passenger vessel when it
    operates as a crew boat carrying individuals other than those
    defined in section 2101(21). If the offshore supply vessel is 500
    gross tons and over it would then be subject to inspection as a
    seagoing motor vessel, a freight vessel, or a passenger vessel.

    authority existing under law on October 5, 1980.
      (i)(1) The Secretary may issue a permit exempting a vessel from
    any part of the requirements of this part for vessels transporting
    cargo, including bulk fuel, from one place in Alaska to another

      (2) Except in a situation declared to be an emergency by the
    Secretary, a vessel operating under a permit may not transport
    cargo to or from a place if the cargo could be transported by

    does not require exemptions to operate legally or if the cargo
    could be readily transported by overland routes.
      (3) A permit may be issued for a specific voyage or for not more
    than one year. The permit may impose specific requirements about
    the amount or type of cargo to be carried, manning, the areas or

    matters. The duration of the permit and restrictions contained in
    the permit shall be at the sole discretion of the Secretary.

    with the terms of the permit, may direct the master or individual
    in charge to take immediate and reasonable steps to safeguard life
    and the environment, including directing the vessel to a port or
    other refuge.
      (5) If a vessel issued a permit creates an immediate threat to
    the safety of life or the environment, or is operated in a manner
    inconsistent with the terms of the permit or the requirements of
    paragraph (2) of this subsection, the permit may be revoked. The
    owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual
    in charge of a vessel issued a permit, that willfully permits the

          (B) a State maritime academy assisted under chapter 515 of
        this title.

      (k) Only the boiler, engine, and other operating machinery of a
    steam vessel that is a recreational vessel of not more than 65 feet
    overall in length are subject to inspection under section 3301(9)
    of this title.
      (l)(1) The Secretary may issue a permit exempting the following
    vessels from the requirements of this part for passenger vessels so
    long as the vessels are owned by nonprofit organizations and
    operated as nonprofit memorials to merchant mariners:

      242209), owned by Project Liberty Ship Baltimore, Incorporated,
      located in Baltimore, Maryland.
        (B) The steamship Lane Victory (United States official number

    requirements about the number of passengers to be carried, manning,
    the areas or specific routes over which the vessel may operate, or
    other similar matters.
      (3) A designated Coast Guard official who has reason to believe
    that a vessel operating under this subsection is in a condition or
    is operated in a manner that creates an immediate threat to life or
    the environment or is operated in a manner that is inconsistent
    with this section, may direct the master or individual in charge to
    take immediate and reasonable steps to safeguard life and the
    environment, including directing the vessel to a port or other
    refuge.
      (m) A seagoing barge is not subject to inspection under section

      Section 3302 does three things. It makes clear that a vessel
    included in one of the ten categories of vessels subject to
    inspection is not necessarily excluded from another category of
    vessel that is subject to inspection. For example, a vessel
    inspected and certified as a small passenger vessel would, when
    carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk as cargo or cargo
    residue, also have to be inspected as a tank vessel. It makes it
    clear that a vessel excluded by section 3302 from the requirements
    of inspection in any one of the ten categories is not necessarily
    excluded from inspection as a vessel in another category. This
    section also contains a number of exemptions for certain classes of
    vessels and for those vessels engaged in a specific trade that have
    been considered to be of a special circumstance.

      Except as provided in chapter 37 and section 3505 of this title,
    a foreign vessel of a country having inspection laws and standards
    similar to those of the United States and that has an unexpired
    certificate of inspection issued by proper authority of its
    respective country, is subject to an inspection to ensure that the
    condition of the vessel is as stated in its current certificate of
    inspection. A foreign country is considered to have inspection laws
    and standards similar to those of the United States when it is a
    party to an International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea to
    which the United States Government is currently a party. A foreign
    certificate of inspection may be accepted as evidence of lawful
    inspection only when presented by a vessel of a country that has by
    its laws accorded to vessels of the United States visiting that
    country the same privileges accorded to vessels of that country
    visiting the United States.

      Section 3303 acknowledges the international concept of comity
    with respect to recognizing inspection laws and standards for
    foreign flag vessels that are similar to those of the United
    States. If a foreign nation is signatory to the International
    Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, it is presumed to have
    similar standards. However, reciprocity requirements for foreign
    flag tank vessels are included in chapter 37. Subsection (b)
    provides for a mutual waiver of fees for the inspection of foreign
    vessels carrying passengers from the United States.

                                AMENDMENTS

    voyages, or not more than 16 individuals in addition to the crew on
    other voyages, is not subject to inspection as a passenger vessel
    or a small passenger vessel if the vessel is otherwise subject to
    inspection under this chapter.
      (b) Except when subsection (e) of this section applies, before an
    individual in addition to the crew is transported on a vessel as
    permitted by this section, the owner, charterer, managing operator,
    agent, master, or individual in charge of the vessel first shall
    notify the individual of the presence on board of dangerous
    articles as defined by law, and of other conditions or
    circumstances that would constitute a risk of safety to the
    individual on board.
      (c) A privilege authorized by this section applies to a vessel of
    a foreign country that affords a similar privilege to vessels of
    the United States in trades not restricted to vessels under its own
    flag.
      (d) A fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel that
    transports not more than 12 individuals employed in the fishing
    industry in addition to the crew is not subject to inspection as a
    passenger or small passenger vessel.
      (e) The Secretary may by regulation allow individuals in addition
    to the crew to be transported in an emergency or under section 2304
    of this title.

      Section 3304 permits the carriage of not more than 12 individuals
    in addition to the crew on international voyages or not more than
    16 individuals in addition to the crew on other voyages without
    subjecting a documented vessel carrying cargo to the inspection
    requirements of a passenger vessel. This section permits the bulk
    of vessels subject to the International Convention for Safety of
    Life at Sea to carry up to 12 passengers and to permit other cargo
    vessels, primarily those engaged in the coastwise trade, to carry
    up to 16 passengers without being categorized as passenger vessels.
    It also requires that these individuals be notified of the presence
    of dangerous articles or other conditions or circumstances that
    constitute a risk of safety. This is of prime importance on tank
    vessels that carry flammable or hazardous cargoes.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The inspection process shall ensure that a vessel subject
    to inspection - 
        (A) is of a structure suitable for the service in which it is
      to be employed;
        (B) is equipped with proper appliances for lifesaving, fire
      prevention, and firefighting;

      instructors, and sailing school students, and for passengers on
      the vessel if authorized to carry passengers;
        (D) has an adequate supply of potable water for drinking and
      washing by passengers and crew;
        (E) is in a condition to be operated with safety to life and
      property; and
        (F) complies with applicable marine safety laws and
      regulations.

      (2) In determining the adequacy of the supply of potable water
    under paragraph (1)(D), the Secretary shall consider - 
        (A) the size and type of vessel;
        (B) the number of passengers or crew on board;
        (C) the duration and routing of voyages; and
        (D) guidelines for potable water recommended by the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention and the Public Health Service.

      (b) If an inspection, or examination under section 3308 of this
    title, reveals that a life preserver, lifesaving device, or
    firehose is defective and incapable of being repaired, the owner or
    master shall destroy the life preserver, lifesaving device, or
    firehose in the presence of the official conducting the inspection
    or examination.
      (c) A nautical school vessel operated by a civilian nautical
    school or by an educational institution under section 558 of title
    40 shall be inspected like a small passenger vessel or a passenger
    vessel, depending on its tonnage.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 3305 consolidates, at one place, the basic scope of
    coverage of the inspection process. It is to be noted that the time
    difference in enactment of various statutes has resulted in some
    anomalies. Thus, for example, R.S. 4417 (46 U.S.C. 391) which had
    originally set periods of inspection and vested authority in "local
    inspectors" was expanded over the years to provide the base for
    inspection of certain classes of vessels as well as setting out the
    periods and scope. The distillation of inspection objectives and
    standards in later laws and the transfer of all functions of
    separately created bureaus and functionaries to the Coast Guard
    permit this consolidation. There are those who have a desire to see
    the scope and standards of inspection be more specific in law
    similar to those presently applicable to boilers and boiler plating
    that predate 1871. The Committee believes this serves no useful
    purpose since the specifics are either antiquated or too limiting
    and have, in fact, been superceded by the statutorily authorized
    adoption of various industrial specifications, standards, and codes
    by the Coast Guard. These include the American Bureau of Shipping
    (ABS), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American
    National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society for Testing
    and Materials (ASTM), American Welding Society (AWS), Underwriters
    Laboratories (UL), and many others. In addition, Coast Guard
    regulations must also implement and conform to the numerous
    international maritime safety treaties to which the United States
    is signatory. The Committee expects that the regulatory flexibility
    being provided will not reduce the present vessel inspection
    requirements that have been historically developed.
      Section 3305(a) establishes the statutory scope of the Coast
    Guard's vessel inspection authority and duty. The inspection
    process shall ensure that a vessel is of suitable structure,
    equipment, and accommodations, is maintained in an operating
    condition consistent with safety of life and property, and complies
    with applicable marine safety laws and regulations.
      Subsection (b) requires that defective life preservers and
    firehose be destroyed in the presence of the inspecting official,
    normally a qualified Coast Guard marine inspector. The Committee
    believes that if this equipment is defective for use on an
    inspected vessel, it should be destroyed so that it cannot be used
    on an uninspected or recreational vessel.
      Subsection (c) provides flexibility in the inspection of various
    sizes of nautical school vessels.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3306. Regulations

-STATUTE-
      (a) To carry out this part and to secure the safety of
    individuals and property on board vessels subject to inspection,
    the Secretary shall prescribe necessary regulations to ensure the
    proper execution of, and to carry out, this part in the most
    effective manner for - 
        (1) the design, construction, alteration, repair, and operation
      of those vessels, including superstructures, hulls, fittings,
      equipment, appliances, propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery,
      boilers, unfired pressure vessels, piping, electric
      installations, and accommodations for passengers and crew,
      sailing school instructors, and sailing school students;
        (2) lifesaving equipment and its use;
        (3) firefighting equipment, its use, and precautionary measures
      to guard against fire;
        (4) inspections and tests related to paragraphs (1), (2), and

      (2) Except with respect to use on a public vessel, the Secretary
    may treat an approval of equipment or materials by a foreign
    government as approval by the Secretary for purposes of paragraph
    (1) if the Secretary determines that - 
        (A) the design standards and testing procedures used by that
      government meet the requirements of the International Convention
      for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974;
        (B) the approval of the equipment or material by the foreign
      government will secure the safety of individuals and property on
      board vessels subject to inspection; and
        (C) for lifesaving equipment, the foreign government - 
          (i) has given equivalent treatment to approvals of lifesaving
        equipment by the Secretary; and
          (ii) otherwise ensures that lifesaving equipment approved by
        the Secretary may be used on vessels that are documented and
        subject to inspection under the laws of that country.

      (c) In prescribing regulations for sailing school vessels, the
    Secretary shall consult with representatives of the private sector
    having experience in the operation of vessels likely to be
    certificated as sailing school vessels. The regulations shall - 
        (1) reflect the specialized nature of sailing school vessel
      operations, and the character, design, and construction of
      vessels operating as sailing school vessels; and
        (2) include requirements for notice to sailing school
      instructors and sailing school students about the specialized
      nature of sailing school vessels and applicable safety
      regulations.

      (d) In prescribing regulations for nautical school vessels
    operated by the United States Merchant Marine Academy or by a State
    maritime academy (as defined in section 51102 of this title), the
    Secretary shall consider the function, purpose, and operation of
    the vessels, their routes, and the number of individuals who may be
    carried on the vessels.
      (e) When the Secretary finds it in the public interest, the
    Secretary may suspend or grant exemptions from the requirements of
    a regulation prescribed under this section related to lifesaving
    and firefighting equipment, muster lists, ground tackle and
    hawsers, and bilge systems.
      (f) In prescribing regulations for offshore supply vessels, the
    Secretary shall consider the characteristics, methods of operation,
    and the nature of the service of offshore supply vessels.
      (g) In prescribing regulations for fish processing or fish tender
    vessels, the Secretary shall consult with representatives of the
    private sector having experience in the operation of these vessels.
    The regulations shall reflect the specialized nature and economics
    of fish processing or fish tender vessel operations and the
    character, design, and construction of fish processing or fish
    tender vessels.
      (h) The Secretary shall establish appropriate structural fire
    protection, manning, operating, and equipment requirements for
    vessels of at least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons as
    measured under section 14502 of this title, or an alternate tonnage
    measured under section 14302 of this title as prescribed by the
    Secretary under section 14104 of this title carrying not more than
    150 passengers on domestic voyages, which meet the eligibility
    criteria of section 2113(4) of this title.
      (i) The Secretary shall establish appropriate structural fire
    protection, manning, operating, and equipment requirements for
    former public vessels of the United States of at least 100 gross
    tons but less that 500 gross tons as measured under section 14502
    of this title, or an alternate tonnage measured under section 14302
    of this title as prescribed by the Secretary under section 14104 of
    this title carrying not more than 150 passengers on domestic
    voyages, which meet the eligibility criteria of section 2113(5) of
    this title.
      (j) The Secretary may establish by regulation a safety management
    system appropriate for the characteristics, methods of operation,
    and nature of service of towing vessels.
      (k)(1) Each vessel of the United States that is constructed under
    a contract entered into after the date of enactment of the Maritime
    Safety Act of 2010, or that is delivered after January 1, 2011,
    with an aggregate capacity of 600 cubic meters or more of oil fuel,
    shall comply with the requirements of Regulation 12A under Annex I
    to the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention
    for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, entitled "Oil
    Fuel Tank Protection".
      (2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to apply the
    requirements described in Regulation 12A to vessels described in
    paragraph (1) that are not otherwise subject to that convention.
    Any such regulation shall be considered to be an interpretive rule
    for the purposes of section 553 of title 5.
      (3) In this subsection the term "oil fuel" means any oil used as
    fuel in connection with the propulsion and auxiliary machinery of
    the vessel in which such oil is carried.

      Section 3306 contains broad authority to prescribe regulations
    for the proper inspection and certification of vessels. It provides
    regulatory flexibility for meeting technological changes. The
    section also permits flexibility in prescribing regulations for
    nautical school vessels operated by the United States Merchant
    Marine Academy or by a State maritime academy. The Secretary may
    suspend or grant exemptions to certain limited inspection
    requirements when the Secretary finds that this is necessary in the
    public interest. It also contains the requirement that in
    regulating offshore supply vessels consideration must be given to
    the special nature of their operations.

    This is normally started during the construction or reconstruction
    phase and is a continuing process until final certification for
    operation in a particular trade. Subsequent periodic inspections
    are also required for various types of vessels. It is to be noted
    that a freight vessel of less than 100 gross tons shall be
    inspected at 3 year intervals while the larger freight vessel has a
    2 year inspection period. This is being done to retain the existing
    procedure of issuing 3 year certificates of inspection to smaller
    vessels, however, this does not prevent periodic inspections or
    examinations at intervening periods.

    individual in charge of a vessel whose certificate has been
    suspended or revoked shall be given written notice immediately of
    the suspension or revocation. The owner or master may appeal to the
    Secretary the suspension or revocation within 30 days of receiving

      Section 3313 requires a vessel to be maintained in a condition so
    as to always be in compliance with the applicable laws and
    regulations. Here the master, owner, or other responsible party is
    required to maintain the vessel to inspection standards and to
    correct all deficiencies observed. When a vessel is not in
    compliance with its certificate the responsible parties shall be
    ordered in writing to correct the deficiencies promptly. The
    section provides flexibility as to when and where these
    deficiencies may be corrected consistent with the safety of the
    vessel and crew. The section provides authority to require the
    vessel to cease operating or, if necessary, to suspend or revoke
    its certificate of inspection when found not to be in compliance
    with its certificate or regulations. The owner or master, or other
    responsible party must be given written notice and may appeal this
    action within 30 days of receiving the notice.

    Sec. 3314. Expiration of certificate of inspection

-STATUTE-
      (a) If the certificate of inspection of a vessel expires when the
    vessel is on a foreign voyage, the vessel may complete the voyage
    to a port of the United States within 30 days of the expiration of
    the certificate without incurring the penalties for operating
    without a certificate of inspection.
      (b) If the certificate of inspection would expire within 15 days
    of sailing on a foreign voyage from a United States port, the
    vessel shall secure a new certificate of inspection before sailing,
    unless the voyage is scheduled to be completed prior to the
    expiration date of the certificate. If a voyage scheduled to be
    completed in that time is not so completed, the applicable
    penalties may be enforced unless the failure to meet the schedule
    was beyond the control of the owner, charterer, managing operator,
    agent, master, or individual in charge of the vessel.
      (c) When the certificate of inspection of a foreign vessel
    carrying passengers, operated on a regularly established line,
    expires at sea after leaving the country to which it belongs or
    when the vessel is in the United States, the Secretary may permit
    the vessel to sail on its regular route without further inspection
    than would have been required had the certificate not expired. This
    permission applies only when the vessel will be regularly inspected
    and issued a certificate before the vessel's next return to the
    United States.

      Section 3315 requires an individual holding a license issued by
    the Coast Guard to assist inspection authorities and to make
    defects and imperfections known to those authorities. Anyone
    licensed also has a duty to report any marine casualty producing
    serious injury to the vessel, its equipment, or individuals on
    board the vessel. These licensed individuals who have this
    statutorily imposed duty to disclose are also protected by
    prohibiting any government official from disclosing the identity or

      Section 3316 prescribes the relationship between certain
    classification societies and the Federal Government with respect to
    the promotion of maritime safety and the security of life and
    property at sea. Briefly stated, a classification society, like the
    American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), establishes and administers
    standards for the design, construction, and periodic survey of
    commercial vessels, yachts, and other marine structures.
    Classification certifies adherence to these standards, thus
    representing that a vessel or structure possesses the structural
    and mechanical fitness required for its intended service.
      The section requires that a Federal department, agency, or
    instrumentality recognize the American Bureau of Shipping as its
    agent for classing vessels owned by the Federal Government and in
    any matters related to classification. In effect, the ABS has a
    statutory monopoly on classing vessels of the United States
    Government. Additionally, the section contains the authority to
    permit the Secretary to rely on reports, documents, and
    certificates issued by a classification society that is similar to
    the American Bureau of Shipping. However, a "similar classification
    society" continues to mean one that is organized like the American
    Bureau of Shipping with attendant governmental representation.

      Section 3317 provides the regulatory authority for prescribing

    permits specific statutory authorization for fee collection.
    Subsection (b) requires the reimbursement of expenses for the
    conduct of an inspection or examination at a foreign port or place
    when done there for the convenience of the owner or operator of the
    vessel.

        (A) the owner or managing operator of the vessel shall notify
      prospective passengers that the vessel does not comply with
      applicable fire safety standards due primarily to the wooden
      construction of passenger berthing areas;
        (B) the owner or managing operator of the vessel may not
      disclaim liability to a passenger for death, injury, or any other
      loss caused by fire due to the negligence of the owner or
      managing operator;
        (C) the penalties provided in section 3504(c) of this title
      apply to a violation of this subsection; and
        (D) the owner or managing operator of the vessel shall notify
      the Coast Guard of structural alterations to the vessel, and with
      regard to those alterations comply with any noncombustible
      material requirements that the Coast Guard prescribes for
      nonpublic spaces. Coast Guard requirements shall be consistent
      with preservation of the historic integrity of the vessel in
      areas carrying or accessible to passengers or generally visible
      to the public.

      (2) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations under this
    subsection on the manner in which prospective passengers are to be

      Section 3503 requires the use of fire retardant materials on a
    vessel having berthing facilities for at least 50 passengers. This
    requirement in the case of vessels engaged in foreign trade is
    consistent with our international treaty obligations, which impose
    extensive and additional fire safety standards. A waiver that
    grandfathers existing inland river passenger vessels is also
    included.

      Section 3504 requires notification to the public of the safety
    standards that are applicable to certain foreign flag or United
    States passenger vessels. In addition, all promotional literature
    or advertising that offers passage or solicits passengers for ocean
    voyages anywhere in the world shall include a safety standard
    statement and shall specify the registry of the vessel. If the
    vessel meets the international standards to which the United States
    adheres, then the safety standard statement need not be included.
    In all other cases the type of safety standard statement that must
    be included is as prescribed by regulation. This section is
    intended to place the United States public on notice as to the
    degree of fire safety compliance of a foreign-flag passenger vessel
    that does not operate or depart from a port or place in the United
    States but does embark passengers from the United States at nearby
    foreign ports. Departures from foreign ports are undertaken because
    the foreign-flag passenger vessel cannot comply with the safety
    standards applicable to a United States flag passenger vessel.

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 111-207, Sec. 2, July 27, 2010, 124 Stat. 2243, provided
    that: "The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) There are approximately 200 overnight ocean-going cruise
      vessels worldwide. The average ocean-going cruise vessel carries
      2,000 passengers with a crew of 950 people.
        "(2) In 2007 alone, approximately 12,000,000 passengers were
      projected to take a cruise worldwide.
        "(3) Passengers on cruise vessels have an inadequate
      appreciation of their potential vulnerability to crime while on
      ocean voyages, and those who may be victimized lack the
      information they need to understand their legal rights or to know
      whom to contact for help in the immediate aftermath of the crime.
        "(4) Sexual violence, the disappearance of passengers from
      vessels on the high seas, and other serious crimes have occurred
      during luxury cruises.
        "(5) Over the last 5 years, sexual assault and physical
      assaults on cruise vessels were the leading crimes investigated
      by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to cruise
      vessel incidents.
        "(6) These crimes at sea can involve attacks both by passengers
      and crewmembers on other passengers and crewmembers.
        "(7) Except for United States flagged vessels, or foreign
      flagged vessels operating in an area subject to the direct
      jurisdiction of the United States, there are no Federal statutes
      or regulations that explicitly require cruise lines to report
      alleged crimes to United States Government officials.
        "(8) It is not known precisely how often crimes occur on cruise
      vessels or exactly how many people have disappeared during ocean
      voyages because cruise line companies do not make comprehensive,
      crime-related data readily available to the public.
        "(9) Obtaining reliable crime-related cruise data from
      governmental sources can be difficult, because multiple countries
      may be involved when a crime occurs on the high seas, including
      the flag country for the vessel, the country of citizenship of
      particular passengers, and any countries having special or
      maritime jurisdiction.
        "(10) It can be difficult for professional crime investigators
      to immediately secure an alleged crime scene on a cruise vessel,
      recover evidence of an onboard offense, and identify or interview
      potential witnesses to the alleged crime.
        "(11) Most cruise vessels that operate into and out of United
      States ports are registered under the laws of another country,
      and investigations and prosecutions of crimes against passengers
      and crewmembers may involve the laws and authorities of multiple
      nations.
        "(12) The Department of Homeland Security has found it
      necessary to establish 500-yard security zones around cruise
      vessels to limit the risk of terrorist attack. Recently piracy
      has dramatically increased throughout the world.
        "(13) To enhance the safety of cruise passengers, the owners of
      cruise vessels could upgrade, modernize, and retrofit the safety
      and security infrastructure on such vessels by installing peep
      holes in passenger room doors, installing security video cameras
      in targeted areas, limiting access to passenger rooms to select
      staff during specific times, and installing acoustic hailing and
      warning devices capable of communicating over distances."

    Sec. 3508. Crime scene preservation training for passenger vessel
      crewmembers

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Within 1 year after the date of enactment of
    the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, the Secretary,
    in consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of
    Investigation and the Maritime Administration, shall develop
    training standards and curricula to allow for the certification of
    passenger vessel security personnel, crewmembers, and law
    enforcement officials on the appropriate methods for prevention,
    detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal
    activities in the international maritime environment. The
    Administrator of the Maritime Administration may certify
    organizations in the United States and abroad that offer the
    curriculum for training and certification under subsection (c).
      (b) Minimum Standards. - The standards established by the
    Secretary under subsection (a) shall include - 
        (1) the training and certification of vessel security
      personnel, crewmembers, and law enforcement officials in
      accordance with accepted law enforcement and security guidelines,
      policies, and procedures, including recommendations for
      incorporating a background check process for personnel trained
      and certified in foreign ports;
        (2) the training of students and instructors in all aspects of
      prevention, detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of
      criminal activities in the international maritime environment;
      and
        (3) the provision or recognition of off-site training and
      certification courses in the United States and foreign countries
      to develop and provide the required training and certification
      described in subsection (a) and to enhance security awareness and
      security practices related to the preservation of evidence in
      response to crimes on board passenger vessels.

      (c) Certification Requirement. - Beginning 2 years after the
    standards are established under subsection (b), no vessel to which
    this section applies may enter a United States port on a voyage (or
    voyage segment) on which a United States citizen is a passenger
    unless there is at least 1 crewmember onboard who is certified as
    having successfully completed training in the prevention,
    detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal
    activities in the international maritime environment on passenger
    vessels under subsection (a).
      (d) Interim Training Requirement. - No vessel to which this
    section applies may enter a United States port on a voyage (or
    voyage segment) on which a United States citizen is a passenger
    unless there is at least 1 crewmember onboard who has been properly
    trained in the prevention detection, evidence preservation and the
    reporting requirements of criminal activities in the international
    maritime environment. The owner of a such a vessel shall maintain
    certification or other documentation, as prescribed by the
    Secretary, verifying the training of such individual and provide
    such documentation upon request for inspection in connection with
    enforcement of the provisions of this section. This subsection
    shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment of the Cruise
    Vessel Safety and Security Act of 2010 and shall remain in effect
    until superseded by the requirements of subsection (c).
      (e) Civil Penalty. - Any person that violates this section or a
    regulation under this section shall be liable for a civil penalty
    of not more than $50,000.
      (f) Denial of Entry. - The Secretary may deny entry into the
    United States to a vessel to which this section applies if the
    owner of the vessel - 
        (1) commits an act or omission for which a penalty may be
      imposed under subsection (e); or
        (2) fails to pay a penalty imposed on the owner under
      subsection (e).

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Chapter 37 consolidates the laws that are applicable to vessels
    that transport oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo
    residue.
      The history of Federal authority to carry out a tank vessel
    safety program begins with the enactment of the so-called Tank
    Vessel Act of 1936 which, as amended, is presently codified in
    section 391a of title 46, United States Code. The 1936 Act remained
    essentially the same until it was amended by the Ports and
    Waterways Safety Act of 1972. The 1972 amendment contained more
    specific standards for the protection of a tank vessel and its crew
    and added vessel standards to improve the quality of the marine
    environment. After a rash of tank vessel accidents during the
    latter part of 1976 and early 1977 within our territorial seas and
    in nearby coastal waters, there was an outpouring of public
    attention to the need to protect United States ports and waterways,
    for the safety of tank vessels, and for the protection of the
    marine environment. This led to the enactment of the Port and
    Tanker Safety Act of 1978, which provided broader and more
    extensive regulatory authority over areas already regulated and
    over many areas not previously regulated. It provided for
    improvements in the supervision and control of vessels of all types
    operating in the navigable waters of the United States, and in the
    safety of all tank vessels, foreign or domestic, that transport or
    transfer oil or hazardous cargoes in ports or places subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States. The 1978 amendments also
    reflect, in part, certain tank vessel standards and requirements
    that have been accepted internationally, in particular those
    developed by the International Conference on Tanker Safety and
    Pollution Prevention held in London in February, 1978.

    the United States or transferring oil or hazardous materials in any
    port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and
    which carries oil or any hazardous materials in bulk as cargo or in
    residue, regardless of tonnage, size or manner of propulsion;
    whether it is self-propelled or not; whether it is carrying freight
    or passengers for hire or not; and whether it is a vessel of the

    which the tank vessel would have been prohibited by subsection (c)
    from operating if the alterations referred to in subparagraph
    (A)(ii)(I) were not made.
      (3) This subsection does not apply to a tank vessel that, before
    July 1, 1997, had undergone, or was the subject of a contract for,
    alterations that reduce the gross tonnage of the tank vessel, as
    shown by reliable evidence acceptable to the Secretary.

      (2) Compliance with paragraph (1) of this subsection may be
    delayed until June 1, 1985, for any tanker of less than 70,000
    deadweight tons that has dedicated clean ballast tanks.
      (c) An existing crude oil tanker of at least 20,000 deadweight
    tons but less than 40,000 deadweight tons, and at least 15 years of

    washing system before January 2, 1986, or the date on which the
    tanker reaches 15 years of age, whichever is later.
      (d) An existing crude oil tanker of at least 20,000 deadweight
    tons shall be equipped with an inert gas system. However, for a
    crude oil tanker of less than 40,000 deadweight tons not fitted
    with high capacity tank washing machines, the Secretary may grant
    an exemption if the vessel's owner can show clearly that compliance
    would be unreasonable and impracticable due to the vessel's design
    characteristics.
      (e) A crude oil tanker engaged in transferring oil from an
    offshore oil exploitation or production facility on the Outer
    Continental Shelf of the United States shall be equipped with

      Section 3705 requires compliance with certain minimum standards
    by a crude oil tanker, which is self-propelled. In general, the
    minimum required standards are consistent with those international
    standards that have been adopted as Protocols to the 1974 Safety of
    Life at Sea Convention and the 1973 Marine Pollution Convention.
      Section 3705(a) requires new crude oil tankers of 20,000
    deadweight tons or above to have protectively located segregated
    ballast tanks, a crude oil washing system, and a specified cargo
    tank protection system.
      Section 3705(b) requires existing crude oil tankers of 40,000
    deadweight tons or above to have segregated ballast tanks or a
    crude oil washing system. Compliance may be delayed until June 1,
    1985 for smaller tankers that have dedicated clean ballast tanks.
      Section 3705(c) requires existing crude oil tankers of 20,000
    deadweight tons or above, but less than 40,000 deadweight tons,
    that are 15 years or older, to have segregated ballast tanks or a
    crude oil washing system by January 1, 1985 or if less than 15
    years old, by the date on which it reaches 15 years of age.
      Section 3705(d) requires existing crude oil tankers of 20,000
    deadweight tons or above, to install an inert gas system. An
    exemption for crude oil tankers of less than 40,000 deadweight tons
    not fitted with high-capacity tank washing machines may be granted
    by the Secretary, only if it is demonstrated that compliance would
    be unreasonable and impracticable due to the vessel's design
    characteristics.
      Section 3705(e) requires existing crude oil tankers of 20,000
    deadweight tons or above, engaged in the transfer of oil from Outer
    Continental Shelf oil exploitation or production facilities, to
    have segregated ballast tanks or be operated with dedicated clean
    ballast tanks or special ballast arrangements.

    certificate only after the vessel has been examined and found to be
    in compliance with this chapter and regulations prescribed under
    this chapter. The Secretary may accept any part of a certificate,
    endorsement, or document, issued by the government of a foreign
    country under a treaty, convention, or other international
    agreement to which the United States is a party, as a basis for
    issuing a certificate of compliance.
      (b) A certificate issued under this section is valid for not more
    than 24 months and may be renewed as specified by the Secretary. In
    appropriate circumstances, the Secretary may issue a temporary
    certificate valid for not more than 30 days.
      (c) A certificate shall be suspended or revoked if the Secretary
    finds that the vessel does not comply with the conditions under
    which the certificate was issued.

      Section 3711 prohibits any foreign vessel from operating on the
    navigable waters of the United States or from transferring oil or
    hazardous material in any port or place under the jurisdiction of
    the United States, unless it has a certificate of compliance issued
    by the Secretary indicating that the vessel has been examined and
    found to be in compliance with the provisions of the applicable
    regulations. It also authorizes the Secretary to accept, in whole
    or in part, an appropriate foreign certificate issued pursuant to
    any international agreement to which the United States is a party,
    as a basis for issuing the certificate of compliance. This means
    that the Secretary does not have to accept foreign certificates as
    evidence of compliance, but may take additional action to assure
    compliance with applicable domestic laws and regulations and
    international treaty provisions.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The Secretary shall have each vessel to which this chapter
    applies inspected or examined at least once each year.
      (2) Each of those vessels that is more than 10 years of age shall
    undergo a special and detailed inspection of structural strength
    and hull integrity as specified by the Secretary.
      (3) The Secretary may make contracts for conducting inspections
    or examinations in the United States and in foreign countries. An
    inspector conducting an inspection or examination under contract
    may not issue a certificate of inspection or a certificate of
    compliance, but the inspector may issue a temporary certificate.
      (4) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation reasonable fees
    for an inspection or examination conducted under this section
    outside the United States, or which, when involving a foreign
    vessel, is conducted under a contract authorized by paragraph (3)
    of this subsection. The owner, charterer, or managing operator of a
    vessel inspected or examined by the Secretary is liable for the
    fees. Amounts received as fees shall be deposited in the Treasury.
      (5) The Secretary may allow provisional entry of a vessel to
    conduct an inspection or examination under this chapter.
      (b) Each vessel to which this chapter applies shall have on board
    those documents the Secretary considers necessary for inspection
    and enforcement, including documents listing - 
        (1) the type, grade, and approximate quantities of cargo on
      board;
        (2) the shipper and consignee of the cargo;
        (3) the places of origin and destination of the vessel; and
        (4) the name of an agent in the United States authorized to
      accept service of legal process.

      (c) Each vessel to which this chapter applies that operates in

      Section 3714(a) requires the Secretary to establish a program for
    the inspection of tank vessels, foreign or domestic, at least once
    each year. The Committee contemplates that United States vessels
    will be issued a 2 year certificate of inspection with a mid-period
    examination. The Committee also contemplates that foreign-flag
    vessels will continue to be tracked and boarded at least once a
    year or when they first arrive in the United States. The Secretary
    may examine the foreign-flag tank vessel but may accept, as a basis
    for the issuance of a certificate of compliance, in whole or in
    part a foreign-issued certificate.
      Each vessel over 10 years of age must undergo a special and
    detailed inspection of structural strength and hull integrity, as
    specified by the Secretary. An inspection or examination may be
    conducted by any officer authorized by the Secretary. The Committee
    expects that, whenever possible, a qualified marine inspector will
    be used wherever the vessel undergoes these 10-year inspections.
    The Secretary may also contract for inspections or examinations in
    the United States and in foreign countries.
      The primary reason for including a provision that permits the
    contracting for the conduct of inspections and examinations is to
    provide flexibility in foreign areas where Coast Guard marine
    inspectors are not normally available.
      A contract inspector may be authorized to act on behalf of the
    Secretary, but may not issue a certificate of inspection or
    compliance. The inspector may, however, issue a temporary
    certificate.
      The Committee understands that the 10-year inspections of United
    States-flag and foreign-flag vessels may occur at the time the
    vessel is scheduled for shipyard availability to complete the
    periodic classification society survey.
      The Secretary is also authorized and directed to prescribe by
    regulation reasonable fees for certain inspections or examinations
    conducted pursuant to this section based on the cost incurred. The
    owner of any vessel inspected or examined by the Secretary or his
    designee shall be liable for the fee. Amounts received as fees
    under this section are to be deposited in the Treasury.
      Section 3714(b) requires each vessel subject to this chapter to
    have on board those documents the Secretary declares are necessary
    for inspection or enforcement, including, but not limited to
    documents indicating the kind, grade, and approximate quantities of
    any cargo on board; the shipper and consignee of the cargo; the
    points of origin and destination of the vessel; and the name of an
    agent in the United States authorized to accept legal process.
      Section 3714(c) requires each vessel subject to this chapter to
    have a person authorized to accept service of legal process for the
    vessel.

      would have been required under section 1016 of the Oil Pollution
      Act of 1990, had the transfer taken place in a place subject to
      the jurisdiction of the United States;
        (4) the delivering and the receiving vessel had on board at the
      time of transfer, evidence that each vessel is operating in
      compliance with section 311(j) of the Federal Water Pollution
      Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(j)); and
        (5) the delivering and the receiving vessel are operating in

      wave height, weather, proximity to channels or shipping lanes,
      and other similar factors;
        (2) the prevention of spills;
        (3) equipment for responding to a spill;
        (4) the prevention of any unreasonable interference with
      navigation or other reasonable uses of the high seas, as those
      uses are defined by treaty, convention, or customary
      international law;
        (5) the establishment of lightering zones; and
        (6) requirements for communication and prearrival messages.

      Section 3715 requires the Secretary to control lightering
    operations; that is, the transferring of cargoes at sea from large
    deep-draft vessels to shallow-draft vessels for subsequent transfer
    to shoreside terminals due to the inability of the larger tank
    vessels to enter shallow ports. It prohibits a tank vessel from
    unloading any cargo of oil or hazardous material at any port or
    terminal under the jurisdiction of the United States, unless the
    cargo has been transferred in accordance with lightering
    regulations. It also prohibits the shoreside transfer unless both
    the delivering and receiving vessels involved in the prior
    lightering had on board at the time of the offshore transfer, the
    certificates that would have been required had the transfer taken
    place in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United
    States.
      The regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary shall include a
    number of specific considerations but may include any related
    matters deemed necessary to promote navigation and vessel safety
    and protection of the marine environment. The Secretary must
    consider standards for minimum safe operating conditions, including
    sea state, wave height, weather, vessel traffic, the prevention of
    oil spills, and oil spill response equipment. In regulating this
    operation, there must not be any unreasonable interference with
    international navigation or reasonable uses of the high seas, and
    there must be established lightering zones with attendant
    communications and prearrival message requirements.

      Section 3716 requires the Secretary to establish effective
    control and supervisory measures to prohibit the discharge of tank
    washings by dumping at sea. The section also prohibits the dumping
    vessel from subsequently loading any cargo at a port or terminal
    subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This section is
    intended to prohibit the practice of discharging a cargo of oil or
    hazardous substance, then going to sea to clean tanks by pumping
    tank washing mixtures overboard, and then returning to a port or
    terminal subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for the
    purpose of loading a cargo that was incompatible with the prior
    cargo.

    this chapter applies that operates on the navigable waters of the
    United States, or that transfers oil or hazardous material in a
    port or place under the jurisdiction of the United States. In

      Section 3717 requires the Secretary to establish a marine safety
    information system which is to contain selected information on any
    tank vessel, foreign or domestic, that comes within the
    jurisdiction of the United States. This information must be
    recorded and maintained up-to-date and is available from a number
    of sources. In some instances, this information is required as a
    condition of entry. This information shall include certain
    ownership interests, financial responsibility information, all
    registered names that the vessel has had since it was built, the
    present and prior countries of registry, history of accidents or
    serious repair problems, record of the various inspections or
    examinations required, and any other data the Secretary deems
    appropriate to carry out the intent of the section. The section
    also provides for interagency cooperation and the furnishing of

      (b) A person willfully and knowingly violating this chapter or a
    regulation prescribed under this chapter commits a class D felony.
      (c) Instead of the penalties provided by subsection (b) of this
    section, a person willfully and knowingly violating this chapter or
    a regulation prescribed under this chapter, and using a dangerous
    weapon, or engaging in conduct that causes bodily injury or fear of
    imminent bodily injury to an official authorized to enforce this
    chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, commits a
    class C felony.
      (d) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to

      Section 3718 provides the authority to assess civil penalties for
    violation of the chapter or regulations. Each violation subjects
    the violator to a penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each violation
    and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day shall
    constitute a separate violation and the vessel is liable in rem.
    The procedures for assessing penalties are found in section 2107 of
    part A.
      With respect to criminal penalties, a willful or knowing
    violation of the section or a regulation subjects the offender,
    upon conviction, to a criminal fine of not more than $50,000 for
    each violation or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.
    If the willful and knowing violation involves the use of a
    dangerous weapon or constitutes an assault or battery, the offender
    is subjected to a fine of not more than $100,000 or imprisonment of
    not more than 10 years, or both.
      In addition, where the owner or operator of the vessel is subject
    to any of the penalties prescribed, the Secretary of the Treasury
    is directed to withhold required Customs clearance, at the request
    of the Secretary. Clearance may be granted upon the filing of a
    bond or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary.

      Chapter 41 applies to vessels that are not subject to inspection
    and certification under chapter 33.
      The Federal authority to regulate uninspected vessels originated
    with the Motorboat Act of 1910 (Public Law 61-201, 36 Stat. 462)
    when Congress established standards with respect to navigation
    lights, machinery requirements, life preservers, and for the
    licensing of operators on small vessels carrying passengers. This
    was an extension of Federal regulatory authority over certain non-
    steam-propelled vessels, that is, those recreational vessels and
    commercial vessels that are propelled by machinery other than
    steam.
      Thirty years later, the 1910 Act was amended by the Motorboat Act
    of 1940 (Public Law 76-484, 54 Stat. 163), which added to the
    equipment that was required and provided for other regulatory
    controls. In this manner the Federal Government continued to
    exercise some degree of maritime safety supervision over the
    commercial and recreational vessel sector that was "uninspected".
    This was important because steam towing vessels were converting to
    diesel propulsion and were therefore no longer subject to the
    detailed periodic and extensive hull, machinery, and equipment
    inspections of a Federal agency. In addition, the number of
    recreational vessels primarily propelled by gasoline were
    increasing and were also suffering casualties from explosions and
    fires.

      (f)(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Towing Safety
    Advisory Committee and taking into consideration the
    characteristics, methods of operation, and nature of service of
    towing vessels, may require the installation, maintenance, and use
    of a fire suppression system or other measures to provide adequate
    assurance that fires on board towing vessels can be suppressed
    under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
      (2) The Secretary shall require under paragraph (1) the use of a
    fire suppression system or other measures to provide adequate
    assurance that a fire on board a towing vessel that is towing a non-
    self-propelled tank vessel can be suppressed under reasonably
    foreseeable circumstances.

      Section 4102 requires uninspected vessels to comply with certain
    provisions that incorporate minimum safety equipment and
    construction requirements. The Committee intends that the term life
    preserver include all types of personal equipment, including
    exposure suits with floatation characteristics.

      Chapter 43 contains the laws applicable to recreational vessels,
    which originated primarily with the enactment of the Federal Boat
    Safety Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-75, 85 Stat. 213). That Act
    embraced a number of activities, but the portion restated in this
    chapter deals with the establishment of national construction and
    performance standards for recreational vessels and their associated
    equipment, the necessary flexible regulatory authority for
    inspection and testing, Federal preemption, certain necessary
    prohibited acts, enforcement authority, investigation and reporting
    requirements, procedures for repair and defect notification, and
    attendant penalties and injunctive relief. These laws are a direct
    response to the dramatic increase in the number of recreational
    boats and the Congressional recognition of the maritime safety
    problems that recreational boating has imposed upon our more than
    25 million miles of waterways.

      (a) This chapter applies to a recreational vessel and associated

    jurisdiction of the United States (including the territorial sea of
    the United States as described in Presidential Proclamation No.
    5928 of December 27, 1988) and, for a vessel owned in the United
    States, on the high seas.
      (b) Except when expressly otherwise provided, this chapter does
    not apply to a foreign vessel temporarily operating on waters
    subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
      (c) Until there is a final judicial decision that they are
    navigable waters of the United States, the following waters lying
    entirely in New Hampshire are declared not to be waters subject to
    the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of this
    section: Lake Winnisquam, Lake Winnipesaukee, parts of the
    Merrimack River, and their tributary and connecting waters.

      Section 4301 provides that this chapter is applicable to a
    recreational vessel that operates on waters subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States or that is owned in the United
    States and while operating on the high seas.
      It also provides that a foreign recreational vessel that
    temporarily uses our waters is not subject to the requirements of
    this chapter. However, if the vessel remains permanently in the
    United States, it would be subject to the provisions of this
    chapter.
      Section 4301(c) recognizes the ongoing controversy over the
    navigability of certain waters of New Hampshire. While a
    recreational vessel operating on these waters need not meet the
    requirements of this chapter, it would be prohibited from operating
    on any other waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United
    States if it does not comply with these requirements.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 4302. Regulations

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary may prescribe regulations - 
        (1) establishing minimum safety standards for recreational
      vessels and associated equipment, and establishing procedures and
      tests required to measure conformance with those standards, with
      each standard - 
          (A) meeting the need for recreational vessel safety; and
          (B) being stated, insofar as practicable, in terms of
        performance;

        (2) requiring the installation, carrying, or use of associated
      equipment (including fuel systems, ventilation systems,
      electrical systems, sound-producing devices, firefighting
      equipment, lifesaving devices, signaling devices, ground tackle,
      life- and grab-rails, and navigational equipment) on recreational
      vessels and classes of recreational vessels subject to this
      chapter, and prohibiting the installation, carrying, or use of
      associated equipment that does not conform with safety standards
      established under this section; and
        (3) requiring or permitting the display of seals, labels,
      plates, insignia, or other devices for certifying or evidencing
      compliance with safety regulations and standards of the United
      States Government for recreational vessels and associated
      equipment.

      (b) Each regulation prescribed under this section shall specify
    an effective date that is not earlier than 180 days from the date
    the regulation was published, unless the Secretary finds that there
    exists a recreational vessel safety hazard so critical as to
    require an earlier effective date. However, this period may not be
    more than 24 months for cases involving, in the discretion of the
    Secretary, major product design, retooling, or major changes in the
    manufacturing process.
      (c) In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary
    shall, among other things - 
        (1) consider the need for and the extent to which the
      regulations will contribute to recreational vessel safety;
        (2) consider relevant available recreational vessel safety
      standards, statistics, and data, including public and private
      research, development, testing, and evaluation;
        (3) not compel substantial alteration of a recreational vessel
      or item of associated equipment that is in existence, or the
      construction or manufacture of which is begun before the
      effective date of the regulation, but subject to that limitation
      may require compliance or performance, to avoid a substantial
      risk of personal injury to the public, that the Secretary
      considers appropriate in relation to the degree of hazard that
      the compliance will correct; and
        (4) consult with the National Boating Safety Advisory Council
      established under section 13110 of this title about the
      considerations referred to in clauses (1)-(3) of this subsection.

      (d) Section 8903 of this title does not apply to a vessel being
    operated for bona fide dealer demonstrations provided without fee
    to business invitees. However, if on the basis of substantial
    evidence, the Secretary decides under this section that requiring
    vessels so operated to be under the control of licensed individuals
    is necessary for boating safety, then the Secretary may prescribe
    regulations requiring the licensing of individuals controlling
    these vessels in the same manner as provided in chapter 89 of this
    title for individuals in control of vessels carrying passengers for
    hire.

      Section 4302 authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to
    carry out the provisions of this chapter. In lieu of establishing
    specific statutory safety requirements, subsection (a) provides
    flexible regulatory authority to establish uniform standards for
    the design, construction, materials, and performance of the boats
    themselves and all associated equipment. It also provides for the
    display of seals and other devices for certifying or evidencing
    compliance with applicable safety regulations or standards.
      Section 4302(b) requires a regulation prescribed under this
    section to have an effective date that is not earlier than 180 days
    from publication. However, in those instances where a safety hazard
    may be critical an earlier effective date is authorized.
      Section 4302(c) requires the Secretary to consider certain
    objectives in developing regulatory controls and regulations or
    standards and that there must be an effective consultation process.
      Section 4302(d) exempts dealer demonstration boats from the
    requirement of having to be named by a licensed individual when
    demonstrating boats to prospective purchasers or other business
    invitees when no fees are charged. The Secretary may require that
    boats so used be under control of a licensed individual.

    Safety Board and recreational boating organizations, shall, within
    24 months of the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 13, 1998],
    assess and report to Congress on the use of emergency position
    indicating beacons (EPIRBs) and similar devices by operators of
    recreational vessels on the Intracoastal Waterway and operators of
    recreational vessels beyond the Boundary Line. The assessment shall
    at a minimum - 
        "(1) evaluate the current availability and use of EPIRBs and
      similar devices by the operators of recreational vessels and the
      actual and potential contribution of such devices to recreational
      boating safety; and

      The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury may authorize by
    joint regulations the importation of any nonconforming recreational
    vessel or associated equipment on conditions, including providing a
    bond, that will ensure that the recreational vessel or associated
    equipment will be brought into conformity with applicable safety
    regulations and standards of the Government before the vessel or
    equipment is operated on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States.

      Section 4304 requires the regulation and control of the
    importation of nonconforming recreational vessels and associated
    equipment. This is to assure United States manufacturers that
    foreign imports comply with those regulations and standards in
    effect for United States products so that all manufacturers will be
    on this same competitive footing. This is being done in lieu of
    providing a specific prohibition against the importation of these
    vessels and equipment that might be considered an imposition of a
    non-tariff barrier to trade.

      Section 4306 establishes the Federal preemption of recreational
    boating standards and requirements. A State or a political
    subdivision may not establish, continue, or enforce a law or
    regulation establishing a performance or other safety standard that
    is not identical to a Federal standard. The Secretary may grant an
    exemption to a State when the State requirement is one that is
    needed to meet uniquely hazardous conditions or circumstances
    within a State. This is to provide uniform standards without the
    imposition of excessive special requirements by individual States.

    discovers or acquires information that the manufacturer decides, in
    the exercise of reasonable and prudent judgment, indicates that a
    recreational vessel or associated equipment subject to an
    applicable regulation prescribed under section 4302 of this title
    either fails to comply with the regulation, or contains a defect
    that creates a substantial risk of personal injury to the public,

      (c)(1) The notification required by subsection (b) of this
    section shall be given to the following persons in the following
    manner:
        (A) by first class mail or by certified mail to the first
      purchaser for other than resale, except that the requirement for
      notification of the first purchaser shall be satisfied if the
      recreational vessel manufacturer exercises reasonable diligence
      in establishing and maintaining a list of those purchasers and
      their current addresses, and sends the required notice to each
      person on that list at the address appearing on the list.
        (B) by first class mail or by certified mail to subsequent
      purchasers if known to the manufacturer.
        (C) by first class mail or by certified mail or other more
      expeditious means to the dealers and distributors of the
      recreational vessels or associated equipment.

      (2) The notification required by subsection (b) of this section
    is required to be given only for a defect or failure of compliance
    discovered by the recreational vessel manufacturer within a
    reasonable time after the manufacturer has discovered the defect or
    failure, except that the manufacturer's duty of notification under
    paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection applies only to a
    defect or failure of compliance discovered by the manufacturer
    within one of the following appropriate periods:
        (A) if a recreational vessel or associated equipment required
      by regulation to have a date of certification affixed, 10 years
      from the date of certification.
        (B) if a recreational vessel or associated equipment not
      required by regulation to have a date of certification affixed,
      10 years from the date of manufacture.

      (d) The notification required by subsection (b) of this section
    shall contain a clear description of the defect or failure to
    comply, an evaluation of the hazard reasonably related to the
    defect or failure, a statement of the measures to correct the
    defect or failure, and an undertaking by the recreational vessel
    manufacturer to take those measures only at the manufacturer's cost
    and expense.
      (e) Each recreational vessel manufacturer shall provide the
    Secretary with a copy of all notices, bulletins, and other
    communications to dealers and distributors of that manufacturer,
    and to purchasers of recreational vessels or associated equipment
    of that manufacturer, about a defect related to safety in the
    recreational vessels or associated equipment, and any failure to
    comply with the regulation or order applicable to the recreational
    vessels or associated equipment. The Secretary may publish or
    otherwise disclose to the public information in the notices or
    other information the Secretary has that the Secretary considers
    will assist in carrying out this chapter. However, the Secretary
    may disclose any information that contains or relates to a trade
    secret only if the Secretary decides that the information is
    necessary to carry out this chapter.
      (f) If, through testing, inspection, investigation, or
    examination of reports, the Secretary decides that a recreational
    vessel or associated equipment to which this chapter applies
    contains a defect related to safety or fails to comply with an
    applicable regulation prescribed under this chapter and
    notification under this chapter is appropriate, the Secretary shall
    notify the recreational vessel manufacturer of the defect or
    failure. The notice shall contain the findings of the Secretary and
    shall include a synopsis of the information on which they are
    based. The manufacturer may then provide the notification required
    by this chapter to the persons designated in this chapter or
    dispute the Secretary's decision. If disputed, the Secretary shall
    provide the manufacturer with an opportunity to present views and
    establish that there is no such defect or failure. When the
    Secretary considers it to be in the public interest, the Secretary
    may publish notice of the proceeding in the Federal Register and
    provide interested persons, including the National Boating Safety
    Advisory Council, with an opportunity to comment. If, after
    presentation by the manufacturer, the Secretary decides that the
    recreational vessel or associated equipment contains a defect
    related to safety or fails to comply with an applicable regulation,
    the Secretary may direct the manufacturer to provide the
    notifications specified in this chapter.
      (g) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out this
    section, including the establishment of procedures that require
    dealers and distributors to assist manufacturers in obtaining
    information required by this section. A regulation prescribed under
    this subsection does not relieve a manufacturer of any obligation
    imposed by this section.

      Section 4310 imposes certain requirements on a recreational
    vessel and associated equipment manufacturer to provide
    notification of a defect or the failure of compliance after a
    manufacturer discovers the defect or failure. This section spells
    out the procedure for notification and who shall be notified. It
    assures the public of notification while protecting the
    manufacturer from the potential of damaging and inaccurate
    disclosures.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 4311. Penalties and injunctions

-STATUTE-
      (a) A person willfully operating a recreational vessel in
    violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this
    chapter shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not
    more than one year, or both.
      (b)(1) A person violating section 4307(a) of this title is liable
    to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more
    than $5,000, except that the maximum civil penalty may be not more
    than $250,000 for a related series of violations.
      (2) If the Secretary decides under section 4310(f) that a
    recreational vessel or associated equipment contains a defect
    related to safety or fails to comply with an applicable regulation
    and directs the manufacturer to provide the notifications specified
    in this chapter, any person, including a director, officer or
    executive employee of a corporation, who knowingly and willfully
    fails to comply with that order, may be fined not more than
    $10,000, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
      (3) When a corporation violates section 4307(a), or fails to
    comply with the Secretary's decision under section 4310(f), any
    director, officer, or executive employee of the corporation who
    knowingly and willfully ordered, or knowingly and willfully
    authorized, a violation is individually liable to the Government
    for a penalty under paragraphs (1) or (2) in addition to the
    corporation. However, the director, officer, or executive employee
    is not liable individually under this subsection if the director,
    officer, or executive employee can demonstrate by a preponderance
    of the evidence that - 
        (A) the order or authorization was issued on the basis of a
      decision, in exercising reasonable and prudent judgment, that the
      defect or the nonconformity with standards and regulations
      constituting the violation would not cause or constitute a
      substantial risk of personal injury to the public; and
        (B) at the time of the order or authorization, the director,
      officer, or executive employee advised the Secretary in writing
      of acting under this subparagraph and subparagraph (A).

      (c) A person violating any other provision of this chapter or
    other regulation prescribed under this chapter is liable to the
    Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. If the
    violation involves the operation of a vessel, the vessel also is
    liable in rem for the penalty.
      (d) When a civil penalty of not more than $200 has been assessed
    under this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter of
    collection of the penalty directly to the United States magistrate
    judge of the jurisdiction in which the person liable may be found
    for collection procedures under supervision of the district court
    and under an order issued by the court delegating this authority
    under section 636(b) of title 28.
      (e) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to
    restrain a violation of this chapter, or to restrain the sale,
    offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction into
    interstate commerce, or importation into the United States, of a
    recreational vessel or associated equipment that the court decides
    does not conform to safety standards of the Government. A civil
    action under this subsection shall be brought by filing a petition
    by the Attorney General for the Government. When practicable, the
    Secretary shall give notice to a person against whom an action for
    injunctive relief is contemplated and provide the person with an
    opportunity to present views and, except for a knowing and willful
    violation, shall provide the person with a reasonable opportunity
    to achieve compliance. The failure to give notice and provide the
    opportunity does not preclude the granting of appropriate relief by
    the district court.
      (f) A person is not subject to a penalty under this chapter if
    the person - 
        (1) establishes that the person did not have reason to know, in
      exercising reasonable care, that a recreational vessel or
      associated equipment does not conform with the applicable safety
      standards of the Government or that the person was not advised by
      the Secretary or the manufacturer of that vessel, equipment or
      component that the vessel, equipment or component contains a
      defect which creates a substantial risk of personal injury to the
      public; or
        (2) holds a certificate issued by the manufacturer of that
      recreational vessel or associated equipment to the effect that
      the recreational vessel or associated equipment conforms to all
      applicable recreational vessel safety standards of the
      Government, unless the person knows or reasonably should have
      known that the recreational vessel or associated equipment does
      not so conform.

      (g) Compliance with this chapter or standards, regulations, or
    orders prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person from
    liability at common law or under State law.

      Section 4311 provides penalties for violating any of the
    provisions of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this
    chapter. For a willful violation the penalty is a criminal fine;
    all other penalties are civil in nature.
      A person violating any of the prohibited acts specified in
    section 4307(a)(1) is subject to a maximum civil penalty that can
    go as high as a $100,000 for a related series of violations.
    However, the section provides for no liability for good faith
    reliance on certifications of compliance by others within the chain
    of responsibility and for defects that are not within an
    individual's responsibility or control.
      This section also contains an alternate procedure for the
    collection of a civil penalty of not more than $200 through a U.S.
    magistrate in lieu of the civil penalty procedures of the Coast
    Guard. It also directs the district courts of the United States to
    restrain the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for
    introduction into interstate commerce, or importation of a
    recreational vessel or associated equipment that does not conform
    to applicable safety standards. Finally, compliance with this
    chapter or standards, regulations, or orders does not relieve a
    person from liability at common law or under State law.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2006 - Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 109-241 inserted a space after
    "4307(a)".
      2004 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 108-293 amended subsec. (b)
    generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows: "A
    person violating section 4307(a)(1) of this title is liable to the
    United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than
    $2,000, except that the maximum civil penalty may be not more than
    $100,000 for a related series of violations. When a corporation
    violates section 4307(a)(1), any director, officer, or executive
    employee of the corporation who knowingly and willfully ordered, or
    knowingly and willfully authorized, a violation is individually
    liable to the Government for the penalty, in addition to the
    corporation. However, the director, officer, or executive employee
    is not liable individually under this subsection if the director,
    officer, or executive employee can demonstrate by a preponderance
    of the evidence that - 
        "(1) the order or authorization was issued on the basis of a
      decision, in exercising reasonable and prudent judgment, that the
      defect or the nonconformity with standards and regulations
      constituting the violation would not cause or constitute a
      substantial risk of personal injury to the public; and
        "(2) at the time of the order or authorization, the director,
      officer, or executive employee advised the Secretary in writing
      of acting under this clause and clause (1) of this subsection."

    Sec. 5101. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      In this chapter - 
        (1) "domestic voyage" means movement of a vessel between places
      in, or subject to the jurisdiction of, the United States, except
      movement between - 
          (A) a place in a territory or possession of the United States
        or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and
          (B) a place outside that territory, possession, or Trust
        Territory.

        (2) "economic benefit of the overloading" means the amount
      obtained by multiplying the weight of the overload (in tons) by
      the lesser of - 
          (A) the average freight rate value of a ton of the vessel's
        cargo for the voyage; or
          (B) $50.

        (3) "existing vessel" means - 
          (A) a vessel on a domestic voyage, the keel of which was
        laid, or that was at a similar stage of construction, before
        January 1, 1986; and
          (B) a vessel on a foreign voyage, the keel of which was laid,
        or that was at a similar stage of construction, before July 21,
        1968.

        (4) "freeboard" means the distance from the mark of the load
      line assigned under this chapter to the freeboard deck.
        (5) "freeboard deck" means the deck or other structure the
      Secretary prescribes by regulation.
        (6) "minimum safe freeboard" means the freeboard that the
      Secretary decides cannot be reduced safely without limiting the
      operation of the vessel.
        (7) "weight of the overload" means the amount obtained by
      multiplying the number of inches that the vessel is submerged
      below the applicable assigned freeboard by the tons-an-inch
      immersion factor for the vessel at the assigned minimum safe
      freeboard.

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

      Revised section 5101
      Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86a.
      Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51 -
     Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines
    only the terms "new ship" and "existing ship") will be replaced by
    section 5101. Definitions of technical terms ("freeboard",
    "freeboard deck", and "minimum safe freeboard") have been added for
    clarity. The definition of the term "new ship" has been deleted
    because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of
    "domestic voyage" includes the phrase "places in or subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States." "Places subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States" include deep water ports,
    production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of
    the United States but within the United States' Exclusive Economic
    Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030,
    dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The
    phrases "economic benefit of overloading" and "weight of the
    overload" have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard
    method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is
    overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum
    penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of
    "freeboard deck" provides the Secretary with the authority to
    designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard
    vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-
    standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is
    necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-
    hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and
    commercial submarines.

      Revised section 5102
      Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86b, 86c, 88.
      The delineation of the vessels that will be subject to load line
    requirements is made in section 5102 as follows: subsection (a) is
    an all-inclusive list of vessels subject to load line requirements,
    followed by subsection (b) which specifically exempts those vessels
    to which the requirements do not apply.
      Section 5102(a) lists five categories of vessels which are
    subject to load line requirements. They are as follows:
      Clause (1) regarding "a vessel of the United States" includes all
    vessels documented under Chapter 121 of title 46 or numbered under
    Chapter 123 of title 46.
      Clause (2) regarding "a vessel on the navigable waters of the
    United States" includes all domestic or foreign vessels found in or
    on the navigable waters of the United States.
      Clause (3) regarding "a vessel owned by a citizen of the United
    States or a corporation established by or under the laws of the
    United States or a State, and not registered in a foreign country"
    includes all vessels owned by citizens of the United States (as
    defined in 5107(7)) [sic] and not registered under the laws of a
    foreign country, wherever the vessels may be located.
      Clause (4) regarding "a public vessel of the United States"
    includes all United States public vessels.
      Clause (5) regarding "a vessel otherwise subject to the
    jurisdiction of the United States" includes foreign vessels that
    are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral
    agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means,
    including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or
    EEZ facilities located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States.
      Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line
    requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:
        (a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing
      vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);
        (b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);
        (c) Minimum size (length); and
        (d) Treaty exclusions.
      Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.
      Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for
    pleasure from load line requirements.
      Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.
      Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and
    fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line
    requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on
    international voyages to ensure compliance with United States
    obligations under the International Load Line Convention.
      Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels
    operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined
    in section 2101 of this title, except vessels operating on the
    Great Lakes.
      Clause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79
    feet) in length from load line requirements whether on
    international or domestic voyages.
      Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public
    vessels that are on domestic voyages.
      Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels
    which have been excluded from the requirements "by specific action
    of a treaty of the United States." The only current treaty which
    excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention
    Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada
    Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685), which entered into force on
    August 11, 1934.
      Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S.
    vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic
    voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing
    exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986
    must be marked with a load line, however, if they are over 79 feet
    long and do not qualify for any other exemption.
      Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic
    voyages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are
    inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal
    Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these
    vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the
    number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel.
    Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include
    hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight
    integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal
    safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific
    exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels
    is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the
    Coast Guard's authority to regulate small passenger vessels under
    Subchapter T.
      Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the
    requirement to have load lines.
      Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for
    any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b)
    upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted
    vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the
    load line requirements until its load line certificate is
    surrendered and the load line marks are removed.
      Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed
    as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to
    which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with
    the International Convention on Load Lines.

    Sec. 5104. Assignment of load lines

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall assign load lines for a vessel so that
    they indicate the minimum safe freeboard to which the vessel may be
    loaded. However, if the owner requests, the Secretary may assign
    load lines that result in greater freeboard than the minimum safe
    freeboard.
      (b) In assigning load lines for a vessel, the Secretary shall
    consider - 
        (1) the service, type, and character of the vessel;
        (2) the geographic area in which the vessel will operate; and
        (3) applicable international agreements to which the United
      States Government is a party.

      (c) An existing vessel may retain its load lines assigned before
    January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that a substantial
    change in the vessel after those load lines were assigned requires
    that new load lines be assigned under this chapter.
      (d) The minimum freeboard of an existing vessel may be reduced
    only if the vessel complies with every applicable provision of this
    chapter.
      (e) The Secretary may designate by regulation specific geographic
    areas that have less severe weather or sea conditions and from
    which there is adequate time to return to available safe harbors.
    The Secretary may reduce the minimum freeboard of a vessel
    operating in these areas.

      Revised section 5104
      Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86c, 88a.
      Section 5104(a) requires the Secretary to assign load lines
    indicating the minimum safe freeboard to which a vessel may be
    loaded. It also authorizes the Secretary to assign a load line that
    results in a freeboard that is greater than the minimum freeboard,
    if the owner requests.
      Section 5104(b) sets forth guidelines that the Secretary must
    consider when assigning load lines on vessels.
      Section 5104(c) allows an existing vessel to retain its load line
    assigned before January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that
    a change made in the vessel requires the assignment of a new load
    line.
      Section 5104(d) is a new provision that requires that a vessel
    comply with all the provisions of this chapter before the Secretary
    will consider a reduction in its minimum freeboard. This provision
    is similar to Article 4(4) of the International Convention on Load
    Lines.
      Section 5104(e) is a new provision that authorized the Secretary
    to designate specific geographic areas having relatively non-severe
    weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to
    return to safe harbors. Section 5104(e) also authorizes the
    Secretary to reduce the minimum freeboard of vessels operating in
    these areas. Regulations that have been issued under this authority
    (46 C.F.R. 44) authorize special service load lines for vessels
    operating not more than 20 nautical miles offshore or between
    islands in a group.

      conditions;
        (3) the stability of the vessel is adequate for all loading
      conditions;
        (4) the topsides of the vessel are arranged and constructed to
      allow rapid overboard drainage of deck water in heavy weather;
      and
        (5) the topsides of the vessel are adequate in design,
      arrangement, and equipment to protect crewmembers performing
      outside tasks necessary for safe operation of the vessel.

    certificate upon finding that a vessel has received a satisfactory
    load line survey and that the vessel's load line is marked
    correctly.
      Section 5106(b) requires that the load line certificate be
    maintained as required by the Secretary of Transportation. It is
    expected that the Secretary will require in most cases that the
    certificate be carried on board the vessel. However, certain types
    of vessels such as barges do not have facilities for the carriage
    of certificates. In this case, this provision would give the
    Secretary the discretion to require that the certificates for the
    barges be carried on the towing vessels.

      Section 5107(a) requires the Secretary to delegate the
    performance of various load line functions to the American Bureau
    of Shipping or other similarly qualified organizations. In
    providing for the delegation to a "similarly qualified
    organization," the Committee expects that the Secretary will ensure
    that that organization complies with the same stringent standards
    and requirements for conducting business that apply to the American
    Bureau of Shipping.
      Section 5107(b) permits an appeal to the Secretary of a decision
    by an organization that has received delegated authority. This
    ensures that the Secretary has full oversight of the delegated load
    line functions.
      Section 5107(c) permits the Secretary to delegate various load
    line functions to another country for vessels that are engaged on a
    foreign voyage, provided that the country is a party to the
    International Convention on Load Lines, 1966.
      Section 5107(d) clarifies the Secretary's authority to revoke a
    delegation at any time without cause. This authority is given so
    that no delay occurs administratively in revoking a delegation
    whenever the Secretary decides a revocation is warranted.

        (1) the vessel is entitled to an exemption under an
      international agreement to which the United States Government is
      a party; or

      Revised section 5108
      Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86e, 88a.
      Section 5108(a) authorizes the Secretary to exempt a vessel from
    load line requirements if the vessel is entitled to an exemption
    under an international agreement to which the United States is a
    party. It also provides the Secretary with the new authority to
    exempt a vessel from load line requirements if the Secretary finds
    that there is good reason for granting the exemption. A specific
    exemption from load line requirements was authorized in Public Law
    98-557 for barges operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor,
    Illinois and Burns Harbor, Indiana, because the geographic area and
    type of operation in this case did not warrant a requirement for
    load lines. Additional exemptions currently must be made by an Act
    of Congress. Section 5108(a) authorizes the Secretary to make such
    exemptions through regulation, and the Committee expects the
    Secretary to continue the exemption under this provision for
    vessels operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor, Illinois
    and Burns Harbor, Indiana.
      Section 5108(b) authorizes the Secretary to issue a certificate
    of exemption when an exemption is granted.
      Section 5108(c) requires that the certificate of exemption be
    maintained as required by the Secretary in a similar manner as
    under section 5106(b).

    was cleared before being detained, the clearance shall be
    withdrawn.
      (c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the owner,
    charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in
    charge of a detained vessel may petition the Secretary to review

      Section 6101(a) requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations
    on the types and manner of reporting of marine casualties to be
    reported under subsection (b) and incidents to be reported under
    subsection (c). The casualties to be reported must include
    casualties involving death to an individual, serious injury to an
    individual, material loss of property, and any damage affecting the
    seaworthiness or efficiency of the vessel, in addition to the other
    casualties (if any) the Secretary feels should be reported.
      Subsection (b) requires the owner, charterer, agent, master,
    operator, or individual in charge of a vessel to report within 5
    days, any casualty required in subsection (a) or by regulation.
      Subsection (c) requires the owner, charterer, managing operator,
    or agent of a U.S. vessel to immediately determine the status of
    their vessel if they have not heard from the vessel, if it has not
    passed a scheduled point, or for any other reason which may
    indicate the vessel may have been lost or imperiled. If the owner,
    charterer, managing operator, or agent cannot reach the vessel and
    determine that it is operating safely, then they shall immediately
    notify the Coast Guard and provide the Coast Guard with the name
    and number of the vessel, the names of individuals on board, and
    any other information that the Coast Guard may request. If
    communication with the vessel indicates the vessel was involved in
    a casualty, then the owner, charterer, or agent of the vessel must
    immediately notify the Coast Guard under subsection (b).
    Notification to the Coast Guard does not impose or create any
    additional responsibility for the Coast Guard to take search and
    rescue action beyond those already existing under title 14, United
    States Code.
      Subsection (d) makes it clear that the reporting requirements
    under subsection (b) are applicable to foreign vessels involved in
    a marine casualty when operating on the navigable waters of the
    United States, whether in innocent passage or not.
      Subsection (e) provides for the classification of marine
    casualties by regulation according to the gravity of the casualty,
    injuries to individuals, property damage, dangers created, and
    size, occupation, and means of propulsion of each vessel.

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for a uniform State
    marine casualty reporting system for vessels. Regulations shall
    prescribe the casualties to be reported and the manner of
    reporting. A State shall compile and submit to the Secretary
    reports, information, and statistics on casualties reported to the
    State, including information and statistics concerning the number

      (b) The Secretary shall collect, analyze, and publish reports,
    information, and statistics on marine casualties together with
    findings and recommendations the Secretary considers appropriate.
    If a State marine casualty reporting system provides that
    information derived from casualty reports (except statistical
    information) may not be publicly disclosed, or otherwise prohibits
    use by the State or any person in any action or proceeding against
    a person, the Secretary may use the information provided by the
    State only in the same way that the State may use the information.

-STATUTE-
      The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the immediate
    investigation of marine casualties under this part to decide, as
    closely as possible - 
        (1) the cause of the casualty, including the cause of any
      death;
        (2) whether an act of misconduct, incompetence, negligence,
      unskillfulness, or willful violation of law committed by any
      individual licensed, certificated, or documented under part E of
      this subtitle has contributed to the cause of the casualty, or to
      a death involved in the casualty, so that appropriate remedial
      action under chapter 77 of this title may be taken;
        (3) whether an act of misconduct, incompetence, negligence,
      unskillfulness, or willful violation of law committed by any
      person, including an officer, employee, or member of the Coast
      Guard, contributed to the cause of the casualty, or to a death
      involved in the casualty;
        (4) whether there is evidence that an act subjecting the
      offender to a civil penalty under the laws of the United States
      has been committed, so that appropriate action may be undertaken
      to collect the penalty;
        (5) whether there is evidence that a criminal act under the
      laws of the United States has been committed, so that the matter
      may be referred to appropriate authorities for prosecution; and
        (6) whether there is need for new laws or regulations, or
      amendment or repeal of existing laws or regulations, to prevent
      the recurrence of the casualty.

      Section 6303 provides for the rights of parties in interest to an
    investigation by allowing them to be represented by counsel, to
    cross examine witnesses, and to call witnesses. This section merely
    states the rights of a party in interest but does not necessarily
    determine who is to be considered a party in interest. Clause (4)
    states that these rights are to be afforded to "any other person
    whose conduct is under investigation" (emphasis added). This
    implies that clauses (1) through (3) apply to individuals whose
    conduct is under investigation. If any individual does not qualify
    for these rights under clauses (1) through (4), that individual can
    still be entitled to these rights under clause (5), if designated
    as a party in interest. Since parties in interest are not clearly
    set out by statute, the Secretary has the authority to do this by
    regulation under section 6301. Thus the rights of these parties as
    presently provided for in existing law have been retained.

    authority granted by this section is coextensive with that of a

    district in which the investigation is conducted.
      (b) When a person fails to obey a subpena issued under this
    section, the district court of the United States for the district
    in which the investigation is conducted or in which the person
    failing to obey is found, shall on proper application issue an
    order directing that person to comply with the subpena. The court
    may punish as contempt any disobedience of its order.
      (c) A witness complying with a subpena issued under this section
    may be paid for actual travel and attendance at the rate provided
    for witnesses in the district courts of the United States.
      (d) An official designated to conduct an investigation under this
    part may issue subpenas as provided in this section and administer
    oaths to witnesses.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no part of a
    report of a marine casualty investigation conducted under section
    6301 of this title, including findings of fact, opinions,
    recommendations, deliberations, or conclusions, shall be admissible
    as evidence or subject to discovery in any civil or administrative
    proceedings, other than an administrative proceeding initiated by
    the United States.
      (b) Any member or employee of the Coast Guard investigating a
    marine casualty pursuant to section 6301 of this title shall not be
    subject to deposition or other discovery, or otherwise testify in
    such proceedings relevant to a marine casualty investigation,
    without the permission of the Secretary. The Secretary shall not
    withhold permission for such employee or member to testify, either
    orally or upon written questions, on solely factual matters at a
    time and place and in a manner acceptable to the Secretary if the
    information is not available elsewhere or is not obtainable by
    other means.
      (c) Nothing in this section prohibits the United States from
    calling the employee or member as an expert witness to testify on
    its behalf. Further, nothing in this section prohibits the employee
    or member from being called as a fact witness in any case in which
    the United States is a party. If the employee or member is called
    as an expert or fact witness, the applicable Federal Rules of Civil
    Procedure govern discovery. If the employee or member is called as
    a witness, the report of a marine casualty investigation conducted
    under section 6301 of this title shall not be admissible, as
    provided in subsections (a) and (b), and shall not be considered
    the report of an expert under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
      (d) The information referred to in subsections (a), (b), and (c)
    of this section shall not be considered an admission of liability
    by the United States or by any person referred to in those
    conclusions and statements.

      The requirement for an oath, drawn from a clause which had

    to all applicants, was repealed in a 1980 amendment by section 4 of
    Public Law 96-378 (94 Stat. 1516). Since no specific comment was
    made regarding the elimination in 1980 and the agency has continued
    to administer an oath to all applicants, this provision is being
    reinstated. The Committee believes the oath will contribute to the
    discipline and order necessary in the merchant marine.

      Section 7704 requires the Secretary to revoke the license,
    certificate, or document of any individual who has been convicted
    of a dangerous drug law within 10 years before the beginning of the
    suspension or revocation procedures. This section has expanded
    current law to incorporate violations involving "controlled
    substances" which are not narcotic. This includes PCP and LSD.
    Unless it can be done under existing law, the suspension or
    revocation of an individual's license based on the use of a
    "controlled substance" only applies to the use or conviction after
    the date of enactment of this Act.
      This section also provides that anyone who has been a user of or
    addicted to a dangerous drug since July 14, 1954, may be subjected
    to revocation procedures unless the individual provides
    satisfactory proof of being cured.
      In sections 7503(b)(2) and 7704(c), the term "use", when applying
    to "narcotic drugs" or "controlled substances", is not intended to
    include the use of "off the shelf" drugs or drugs acquired with a
    prescription lawfully issued by a medical doctor, as long as the
    drugs are used by the individual in the recommended amounts and the
    drugs will not impair the individual's ability to perform duties.

    drug, controlled substance, and marihuana.

      (c) A requirement made under this section by an authorized
    official may be appealed to the Secretary under prescribed
    regulations.
      (d) A vessel to which this section applies may not be operated
    without having in its service the complement required in the
    certificate of inspection.
      (e) When a vessel is deprived of the service of a member of its
    complement without the consent, fault, or collusion of the owner,
    charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in
    charge of the vessel, the master shall engage, if obtainable, a
    number of members equal to the number of those of whose services
    the master has been deprived. The replacements must be of the same
    or a higher grade or rating than those whose places they fill. If
    the master finds the vessel is sufficiently manned for the voyage,
    and replacements are not available to fill all the vacancies, the
    vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12 hours after the vessel
    arrives at its destination, the master shall report in writing to
    the Secretary the cause of each deficiency in the complement. A
    master failing to make the report is liable to the United States
    Government for a civil penalty of $1,000 for each deficiency.

    of a vessel to which this part applies or which is subject to
    inspection under chapter 33 of this title if the individual is not
    licensed by the Secretary. A person (including an individual)
    violating this subsection is liable to the Government for a civil
    penalty of not more than $10,000. Each day of a continuing
    violation is a separate offense.
      (h) The owner, charterer, or managing operator of a freight
    vessel of less than 100 gross tons as measured under section 14502
    of this title, or an alternate tonnage measured under section 14302
    of this title as prescribed by the Secretary under section 14104 of
    this title, a small passenger vessel, or a sailing school vessel
    not manned as required by this section is liable to the Government
    for a civil penalty of $1,000. The vessel also is liable in rem for
    the penalty.
      (i) When the 2 next most senior licensed officers on a vessel
    reasonably believe that the master or individual in charge of the
    vessel is under the influence of alcohol or a dangerous drug and is
    incapable of commanding the vessel, the next most senior master,
    mate, or operator licensed under section 7101(c)(1) or (3) of this
    title shall - 
        (1) temporarily relieve the master or individual in charge;
        (2) temporarily take command of the vessel;
        (3) in the case of a vessel required to have a log under
      chapter 113 of this title, immediately enter the details of the
      incident in the log; and
        (4) report those details to the Secretary - 
          (A) by the most expeditious means available; and
          (B) in written form transmitted within 12 hours after the
        vessel arrives at its next port.

      Section 8101 provides for the required composition of the
    complement of licensed individuals and crew of an inspected vessel
    when being operated.
      Subsection (a) requires that the certificate of inspection for a
    vessel state the manning necessary for safe navigation. Manning
    means the complement of licensed officers and crew (including
    lifeboatmen). Any manning requirements for sailing school vessels
    shall take into account the participation of sailing school
    instructors and sailing school students in the operation of those
    vessels.
      Subsection (b) permits the Secretary to modify the manning
    requirements for reasons of changed conditions or employment.
      Subsection (c) permits an appeal to the Secretary of any manning
    requirements made by an authorized official.
      Subsection (d) prohibits the operation of a vessel without the
    manning required in the vessel's certificate of inspection.
      When a vessel has a vacancy in the manning required by its
    certificate of inspection without the consent, fault, or collusion
    of anyone responsible for the management or operation of the
    vessel, subsection (e) requires that the master hire replacements,
    if possible, in the same or higher grade or rating. However, if the
    master finds the vessel sufficiently manned and replacements are
    not available, the vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12
    hours of arrival at its destination, the master is required to file
    a written report with the Secretary stating the cause of each
    deficiency or be liable for a civil penalty. The report of
    deficiency should include both the reason for the vacancy in the
    first instance and the reason for the unavailability of a qualified
    replacement.
      Subsections (f), (g) and (h) prescribe civil penalties for
    noncompliance with manning requirements. Subsection (g) also
    prohibits the employment or service of an individual in a licensed
    capacity who is not licensed by the Secretary.

      Section 8103 sets forth the requirements for citizenship and
    Naval Reserve membership for the complement on a vessel documented
    under the laws of the United States.
      Subsection (a) requires that the master, chief engineer, or
    officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch on a United States
    documented vessel be a United States citizen.
      Subsection (b) requires that 75 percent of the seamen, excluding
    licensed individuals, on a United States documented vessel be
    United States citizens, except for a fishing or whaling vessel or
    yacht. The Secretary may reduce the percentage if the Secretary
    decides on investigation that United States seamen are not
    available. This investigation and percentage reduction authority is
    the sole responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation and
    accordingly the Secretary is to make these decisions expeditiously,
    promptly, and independently so as not to be dependent on any other
    agency to make this reduction. The Committee believes the Secretary
    is capable of this decision and need not delay or fail to make the
    decision because some other agency does not have the information or
    would require an extended period to acquire that information. The
    phrase "for any reason" is used merely to emphasize the complete
    discretion of the Secretary in making this decision. In addition,
    because this decision is based on an investigation, formal
    procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.
      Subsections (c) and (d) provide that a vessel, except a passenger
    vessel, on departure from the United States that has been granted a
    construction or operating differential subsidy have a higher
    percentage citizenship requirement. Subsection (c) requires all of
    the crew and employees of a cargo vessel be United States citizens.
    Subsection (d) requires at least 90 percent of the entire
    complement of a passenger vessel be United States citizens. The
    phrase "including all licensed individuals" emphasizes that all
    licensed individuals are required to be United States citizens as
    required by subsection (a) and that they compose part of the 90
    percent requirement under this subsection. Further, under
    subsection (d), the balance of the complement must be individuals
    who have a declaration of intention to become a United States
    citizen or evidence of admission to the United States as a
    permanent resident and may only be employed in the steward's
    department of the passenger vessel.
      Except for the master, subsection (e) permits a non-United States
    citizen to fill a vacancy that occurs for any reason on a United
    States documented vessel during a foreign voyage until the vessel
    returns to a United States port where a United States citizen
    replacement can be obtained. The phrase "for any reason" is used
    merely for emphasis.
      Subsection (f) provides for the penalty for violation of this
    section.
      Subsection (g) requires a deck or engineer officer on a vessel
    that has been granted an operating differential subsidy or is under
    the control by the Department of Transportation to be, if eligible,
    a member of the Naval Reserve. This section does not apply to a
    vessel of the Coast Guard or the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development
    Corporation.
      Subsection (h) permits the President to suspend the requirements
    of this section during a proclaimed national emergency or the
    requirement of subsection (a) for United States vessels documented
    for foreign trade when the needs of commerce require.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 8104 prescribes certain working hours and conditions
    under which working hours are set. The Committee intends that these
    sections be interpreted in a manner consistent with one another.
      Subsection (a) permits an individual to take charge of the deck
    watch on leaving port and immediately thereafter only if the
    individual has been off duty for 6 of the 12 hours immediately
    prior to departure.
      Subsection (b) prohibits a licensed individual from being
    required to work more than 9 of 24 hours in port or more than 12 of
    24 hours at sea on an oceangoing or coastwise vessel of not more
    than 100 gross tons, except in an emergency.
      Subsection (c) prescribes a maximum 8-hour day for licensed
    individuals and seamen on towing vessels operating on the Great
    Lakes and certain connecting or tributary waters.
      Subsection (d) requires certain members of the complement of
    certain merchant vessels of more than 100 gross tons to be divided
    into at least 3 successive watches when at sea. This requirement
    applies to radio officers only when at least 3 radio officers are
    employed. Subsection (d) also prescribes a maximum 8-hour work day
    for licensed individuals and seamen on these vessels.
      For the Great Lakes towing vessels and merchant vessels in
    subsections (c) and (d), subsection (e) requires that seamen be
    hired only for work in either the deck or the engine department.
    When in a safe harbor, seamen may be required to do only necessary
    work on Sundays and certain holidays, unless the vessel is getting
    underway on a voyage. Further, when in a safe harbor, this
    subsection restates the maximum 8-hour work day which applies even
    for anchor watch.
      Subsection (f) states that the limitations in subsections (d) and
    (e) do not apply if the master or other officer decides the crew is
    needed for certain routine, safety, or rescue activities.
      Subsection (g) provides that for a towing vessel (except a Great
    Lakes towing vessel under subsection (c)), offshore supply vessel,
    or barge on a voyage of less than 600 miles, the licensed officers
    and certain crewmembers may be divided into not less than two
    watches when at sea.
      Subsection (h) provides that the licensed operator for a towing
    vessel at least 26 feet long may not be required to work more than
    12 of 24 hours, except in an emergency.
      Subsections (i) and (j) prescribe penalties for violations of the
    provisions of this section and, in certain instances, entitles the
    seaman to discharge and payment of wages.

      next port of call reached by the vessel after the date on which
      the 60-workday limit is reached.
        (2) Calculation. - For the purpose of calculating the 60-

        repairs performed in a shipyard located outside of the United
        States.

        (2) Citizenship requirement. - Subsection (a)(1)(A) applies
      only to a riding gang member described in paragraph (1) who is on
      the vessel when it calls at a United States port.

    except a yacht, a fishing, whaling, or certain types of inland
    waterway vessel, and a ferry carrying passengers or cars on the
    Great Lakes. A ferry is a vessel that primarily carries passengers,
    cars, or trains from shore to shore as a means to connect existing
    points on a transportation route so that the same type of
    transportation mode may continue to be used upon arrival at either
    point. Vessels carrying cars as cargo would not be included in this
    type of vessel.
      Subsection (b) establishes the staff department as a separate one
    consisting of registered individuals (pursers, medical doctors, and
    professional nurses), clerks, and medical assistants. Subsection
    (c) divides the department into a medical division and a purser's
    division and designates the individual in charge of each division.
    Subsection (d) prescribes particular requirements of the purser's
    division based on size of the vessel or number of individuals
    employed in the division.
      Subsection (e) prohibits the employment or service of an
    individual who is not registered or of the grade as required under
    this section and prescribes a penalty for violation of the
    subsection. This penalty applies to both the employer and the
    individual employed. If a registered staff officer is unavailable
    at the time of departure for a voyage, the vessel may proceed on
    its voyage with either an unregistered staff officer or without a
    staff officer.
      Subsection (f) prohibits including a staff officer on a vessel's
    certificate of inspection.
      Subsections (g) and (h) prescribe the type and restrictions for
    the uniform accouterments of a staff officer.

      Chapter 85 provides for State pilotage to be regulated by the
    States and only in conformity with the laws of the States. It
    clearly spells out the preeminence of the State's role in
    regulating pilots for vessels operating on the bays, rivers,
    harbors, and ports of the United States. However, those vessels
    that are required to have a Federally licensed pilot, those that
    operate on waters outside the territorial sea of the United States,
    and those that operate on waters of the Great Lakes are not subject
    to State pilotage laws or requirements. In essence this chapter,
    with minor changes, confirms the State and Federal relationship
    with respect to pilotage that has evolved since the founding of the
    Nation.
      This chapter permits the continuation of Federal pilotage
    requirements for vessels that are not required to obtain compulsory
    State pilotage. It confirms the practice of allowing anyone with a
    Federal pilotage endorsement for the waters in which the vessel is
    operating to be in control of a vessel when engaged in the
    coastwide trade. It also confirms the practice of using Federal
    pilots that are often organized into groups or working
    organizations who offer their expertise and services to vessels
    that are not required to obtain compulsory State pilotage.

    discriminates in the rate of pilotage or half-pilotage between
    vessels sailing between the ports of one State and vessels sailing
    between the ports of different States, or against vessels because
    of their means of propulsion, or against public vessels of the
    United States.
      (d) A State may not adopt a regulation or provision that requires
    a coastwise vessel to take a pilot licensed or authorized by the
    laws of a State if the vessel -

      Section 8501 establishes the general proposition that the States
    regulate pilots in the bays, rivers, harbors, and ports of the
    United States, unless otherwise specifically provided by law.
      Subsection (a) states this general proposition and uses the word
    "only" for emphasis on this point. Further, except as specifically
    provided in law, the Committee intends that this chapter not be
    construed to annul or affect any regulation established by the laws
    of a State requiring a vessel entering or leaving a port in that
    State to employ a pilot licensed or authorized by the laws of that
    State. In at least two places in current law, this general
    proposition is stated in both a positive and negative manner. The
    Committee intends to consolidate those separate statements into one
    provision to avoid ambiguity and redundancy.
      Subsections (b) and (c) contain provisions regarding pilotage in
    waters between two States.
      Subsection (d) prohibits a State from requiring a State licensed
    pilot on certain coastwise vessels.
      Subsection (e) voids any regulation or provision violating this
    section.

    the vessel is - 
        (1) not sailing on register;
        (2) underway;

    rates in the States in which the pilotage is performed.
      (c) A State or political subdivision of a State may not impose on
    a pilot licensed under this subtitle an obligation to procure a
    State or other license, or adopt any other regulation that will
    impede the pilot in the performance of the pilot's duties under the
    laws of the United States.
      (d) A State or political subdivision of a State may not levy
    pilot charges on a vessel lawfully piloted by a pilot required
    under this section.
      (e) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or
    individual in charge of a vessel operated in violation of this
    section or a regulation prescribed under this section is liable to
    the United States Government for a civil penalty of $10,000. The
    vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.
      (f) An individual serving as a pilot without having a license
    required by this section or a regulation prescribed under this
    section is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of $10,000.
      (g)(1) The Secretary shall designate by regulation the areas of
    the approaches to and waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska, if
    any, on which a vessel subject to this section is not required to
    be under the direction and control of a pilot licensed under
    section 7101 of this title.
      (2) In any area of Prince William Sound, Alaska, where a vessel
    subject to this section is required to be under the direction and
    control of a pilot licensed under section 7101 of this title, the
    pilot may not be a member of the crew of that vessel and shall be a
    pilot licensed by the State of Alaska who is operating under a
    Federal license, when the vessel is navigating waters between
    60&#186;<!-- degrees -->49 North latitude and the Port of Valdez,
    Alaska.
      (h) The Secretary shall designate waters on which tankers over
    1,600 gross tons subject to this section shall have on the bridge a
    master or mate licensed to direct and control the vessel under
    section 7101(c)(1) of this title who is separate and distinct from
    the pilot required under subsection (a) of this section.
      (i)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a dredge to which
    this section would otherwise apply is exempt from the requirements
    of this section.
      (2) If the Secretary determines, after notice and comment, that
    the exemption under paragraph (1) creates a hazard to navigational
    safety in a specified area, the Secretary may require that a dredge
    exempted by paragraph (1) which is operating in that area shall
    comply with this section.

      Section 8703 sets requirements for tankermen on board vessels
    carrying oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo
    residue.
      Subsection (a) requires a specified number of the crew certified
    as tankermen on board these vessels and a notation be made to that
    effect on the vessel's certificate of inspection. A tankerman is an
    individual who is experienced and trained in the procedures for
    transferring oil or hazardous material to or from a vessel and is
    responsible for carrying out these duties and responsibilities.
      Subsection (b) authorizes the Secretary to regulate tankermen and
    restrict the types of oil or hazardous materials on the basis of
    safety to the vessel and the marine environment.
      Subsection (c) requires a tankerman or licensed master, pilot,
    engineer, or operator to be present and in charge of a transfer of
    oil or hazardous material on certain vessels in the service of oil
    exploitation. If this individual is not on board, then the tank
    vessel requirements of chapter 37 apply to the vessel.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) The Secretary shall evaluate the manning, training,
    qualification, and watchkeeping standards of a foreign country that
    issues documentation for any vessel to which chapter 37 of this
    title applies - 
        (A) on a periodic basis; and
        (B) when the vessel is involved in a marine casualty required
      to be reported under section 6101(a)(4) or (5) of this title.

      (2) After each evaluation made under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, the Secretary shall determine whether - 
        (A) the foreign country has standards for licensing and
      certification of seamen that are at least equivalent to United
      States law or international standards accepted by the United
      States; and
        (B) those standards are being enforced.

      (3) If the Secretary determines under this subsection that a
    country has failed to maintain or enforce standards at least
    equivalent to United States law or international standards accepted
    by the United States, the Secretary shall prohibit vessels issued
    documentation by that country from entering the United States until
    the Secretary determines those standards have been established and
    are being enforced.
      (4) The Secretary may allow provisional entry of a vessel
    prohibited from entering the United States under paragraph (3) of
    this subsection if - 
        (A) the owner or operator of the vessel establishes, to the
      satisfaction of the Secretary, that the vessel is not unsafe or a
      threat to the marine environment; or
        (B) the entry is necessary for the safety of the vessel or
      individuals on the vessel.

      (b) A foreign vessel to which chapter 37 of this title applies
    that has on board oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or
    cargo residue shall have a specified number of personnel certified
    as tankerman or equivalent, as required by the Secretary, when the
    vessel transfers oil or hazardous material in a port or place
    subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The requirement
    of this subsection shall be noted in applicable terminal operating
    procedures. A transfer operation may take place only if the
    crewmember in charge is capable of clearly understanding
    instructions in English.

      Subsection (a) requires each United States vessel sailing on
    register and each foreign vessel to engage a United States or
    Canadian registered pilot who shall direct the navigation of the
    vessel in designated waters of the Great Lakes or be available to
    direct the navigation of the vessel in undesignated waters of the
    Great Lakes. The President must make the designation with regard to
    public interest, effective use of navigable waters, marine safety,
    and United States foreign relations. The direction of the vessel by
    an authorized pilot is subject to the customary authority of the
    master.
      Subsection (b) provides that a crewmember licensed for Great
    Lakes navigation under section 7101 or equivalent Canadian law may
    serve as the pilot on undesignated waters.
      Subsection (c) provides for reciprocity of recognizing United
    States and Canadian pilots.
      Subsections (d) and (e) are exceptions to subsection (a).
    Subsection (d) permits operation of a vessel on the Great Lakes
    without a registered pilot if notice is given that one is not
    available or if the vessel or cargo is in distress or jeopardy.
    Subsection (e) exempts a Canadian vessel in the coastwise or Great
    Lakes trade from the requirement of having a registered pilot if
    similar United States vessels are extended the same exemption by
    Canada.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 10313. Wages

-STATUTE-
      (a) A seaman's entitlement to wages and provisions begins when
    the seaman begins work or when specified in the agreement required
    by section 10302 of this title for the seaman to begin work or be
    present on board, whichever is earlier.
      (b) Wages are not dependent on the earning of freight by the
    vessel. When the loss or wreck of the vessel ends the service of a
    seaman before the end of the period contemplated in the agreement,
    the seaman is entitled to wages for the period of time actually
    served. The seaman shall be deemed a destitute seaman under section
    11104 of this title. This subsection applies to a fishing or
    whaling vessel but not a yacht.
      (c) When a seaman who has signed an agreement is discharged
    improperly before the beginning of the voyage or before one month's
    wages are earned, without the seaman's consent and without the
    seaman's fault justifying discharge, the seaman is entitled to
    receive from the master or owner, in addition to wages earned, one
    month's wages as compensation.
      (d) A seaman is not entitled to wages for a period during which
    the seaman - 
        (1) unlawfully failed to work when required, after the time
      fixed by the agreement for the seaman to begin work; or
        (2) lawfully was imprisoned for an offense, unless a court
      hearing the case otherwise directs.

      (e) After the beginning of the voyage, a seaman is entitled to
    receive from the master, on demand, one-half of the balance of
    wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or
    delivers cargo during the voyage. A demand may not be made before
    the expiration of 5 days from the beginning of the voyage, not more
    than once in 5 days, and not more than once in the same port on the
    same entry. If a master does not comply with this subsection, the
    seaman is released from the agreement and is entitled to payment of
    all wages earned. Notwithstanding a release signed by a seaman
    under section 10312 of this title, a court having jurisdiction may
    set aside, for good cause shown, the release and take action that
    justice requires. This subsection does not apply to a fishing or
    whaling vessel or a yacht.
      (f) At the end of a voyage, the master shall pay each seaman the
    balance of wages due the seaman within 24 hours after the cargo has
    been discharged or within 4 days after the seaman is discharged,
    whichever is earlier. When a seaman is discharged and final payment
    of wages is delayed for the period permitted by this subsection,
    the seaman is entitled at the time of discharge to one-third of the
    wages due the seaman.
      (g)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), when payment is not made as
    provided under subsection (f) of this section without sufficient
    cause, the master or owner shall pay to the seaman 2 days' wages
    for each day payment is delayed.
      (2) The total amount required to be paid under paragraph (1) with
    respect to all claims in a class action suit by seamen on a
    passenger vessel capable of carrying more than 500 passengers for
    wages under this section against a vessel master, owner, or
    operator or the employer of the seamen shall not exceed ten times
    the unpaid wages that are the subject of the claims.
      (3) A class action suit for wages under this subsection must be
    commenced within three years after the later of - 
        (A) the date of the end of the last voyage for which the wages
      are claimed; or
        (B) the receipt, by a seaman who is a claimant in the suit, of
      a payment of wages that are the subject of the suit that is made

      Section 10313 provides that a seaman's entitlement to wages
    begins when the seaman begins work, or as specified in the shipping
    agreement. This section also qualifies a seaman's entitlement to
    wages if the vessel is lost or wrecked, if the seaman is discharged
    improperly, or if the seaman unlawfully failed to work or was
    imprisoned. It also establishes procedures for the payment of wages
    at each port the vessel loads or unloads cargo, and at the end of
    the voyage. This section applies to seamen on foreign vessels in
    United States harbors, but not to fishing vessels, whaling vessels
    or yachts.

      has earned the wages;
        (B) pay advance wages of the seaman to another person; or

      (b) A person demanding or receiving from a seaman or an
    individual seeking employment as a seaman, remuneration for
    providing the seaman or individual with employment, is liable to
    the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $500.
      (c) This section applies to a foreign vessel when in waters of

    or master of a foreign vessel violating this section is liable to
    the Government for the same penalty as an owner, charterer,
    managing operator, agent, or master of a vessel of the United
    States for the same violation.
      (d) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, or master of
    a vessel seeking clearance from a port of the United States shall
    present the agreement required by section 10302 of this title at

      Section 10314 forbids advance payment of wages to seamen prior to
    the commencement of the seaman's employment. It provides a civil
    penalty of $500 for any person making such a payment, and for any
    person demanding or receiving remuneration for providing a seaman
    with employment. This means that the use of employment agencies for
    hiring seamen is prohibited. It also requires compliance with
    section 10302 regarding the signing of articles of agreement before
    a vessel can be cleared from a United States port. This section
    applies to foreign vessels in United States waters but not to
    fishing vessels, whaling vessels or yachts.

    Sec. 10315. Allotments

-STATUTE-
      (a) Under prescribed regulations, a seaman may stipulate as
    follows in the agreement required by section 10302 of this title
    for an allotment of any part of the wages the seaman may earn:
        (1) to the seaman's grandparents, parents, spouse, sister,
      brother, or children;
        (2) to an agency designated by the Secretary of the Treasury to
      handle applications for United States savings bonds, to purchase
      bonds for the seaman; and
        (3) for deposits to be made in an account for savings or
      investment opened by the seaman and maintained in the seaman's
      name at a savings bank or a savings institution in which the
      accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
      or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.

      (b) An allotment is valid only if made in writing and signed by
    and approved by a shipping commissioner. The shipping commissioner
    shall examine allotments and the parties to them to enforce
    compliance with the law. Stipulations for allotments made at the
    beginning of a voyage shall be included in the agreement and shall
    state the amounts and times of payment and the person to whom
    payments are to be made.
      (c) Only an allotment complying with this section is lawful. A
    person falsely claiming qualification as an allottee under this
    section is liable to the United States Government for a civil
    penalty of not more than $500.
      (d) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, or master of
    a vessel seeking clearance from a port of the United States shall
    present the agreement at the office of clearance. Clearance may be
    granted to a vessel only if this section has been complied with.
      (e) This section applies to a foreign vessel when in waters of
    the United States. An owner, charterer, managing operator, agent,
    or master of a foreign vessel violating this section is liable to
    the Government for the same penalty as an owner, charterer,
    managing operator, agent, or master of a vessel of the United
    States for the same violation.
      (f) Deposits in Seaman Account. - By written request signed by
    the seaman, a seaman employed on a passenger vessel capable of
    carrying more than 500 passengers may authorize the master, owner,
    or operator of the vessel, or the employer of the seaman, to make
    deposits of wages of the seaman into a checking, savings,
    investment, or retirement account, or other account to secure a
    payroll or debit card for the seaman if - 
        (1) the wages designated by the seaman for such deposit are
      deposited in a United States or international financial
      institution designated by the seaman;
        (2) such deposits in the financial institution are fully
      guaranteed under commonly accepted international standards by the
      government of the country in which the financial institution is
      licensed;
        (3) a written wage statement or pay stub, including an
      accounting of any direct deposit, is delivered to the seaman no
      less often than monthly; and
        (4) while on board the vessel on which the seaman is employed,
      the seaman is able to arrange for withdrawal of all funds on
      deposit in the account in which the wages are deposited.

        (1) the deductions are paid into a trust fund established only
      for the benefit of seamen employed by that employer, and the
      families and dependents of those seamen (or of those seamen,
      families, and dependents jointly with other seamen employed by
      other employers, and the families and dependents of the other
      seamen); and
        (2) the payments are held in trust to provide, from principal
      or interest, or both, any of the following benefits for those
      seamen and their families and dependents:
          (A) medical or hospital care, or both.
          (B) pensions on retirement or death of the seaman.
          (C) life insurance.

    Sec. 10318. Wages on discharge in foreign ports

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a master or seaman applies to a consular officer for the
    discharge of the seaman, the consular officer shall require the
    master to pay the seaman's wages if it appears that the seaman has
    carried out the agreement required by section 10302 of this title
    or otherwise is entitled to be discharged. Then the consular
    officer shall discharge the seaman. A consular officer shall
    require the payment of extra wages only as provided in this section
    or in chapter 109 of this title.
      (b) When discharging a seaman, a consular officer who fails to
    require the payment of the wages due a seaman at the time, and of
    the extra wages due under subsection (a) of this section, is
    accountable to the United States Government for the total amount.
      (c) A seaman discharged under this section with the consent of
    the seaman is entitled to wages up to the time of discharge, but
    not for any additional period.
      (d) If the seaman is discharged involuntarily, and it appears
    that the discharge was not because of neglect of duty,
    incompetency, or injury incurred on the vessel, the master shall
    provide the seaman with employment on a vessel agreed to by the
    seaman or shall provide the seaman with one month's extra wages.
      (e) Expenses for the maintenance and return of an ill or injured
    seaman to the United States shall be paid by the Secretary of
    State. If a seaman is incapacitated by illness or injury and prompt
    discharge is necessary, but a personal appearance of the master
    before a consular officer is impracticable, the master may provide
    transportation to the seaman to the nearest consular officer for
    discharge.
      (f) A deduction from wages of the seaman is permitted only if the
    deduction appears in the account of the seaman required to be
    delivered under section 10310 of this title, except for matters
    arising after delivery of the account, in which case a
    supplementary account is required. During a voyage, the master
    shall record in the official logbook the matters about which
    deductions are to be made with the amounts of the deductions. The
    entries shall be made as the matters occur. The master shall
    produce the official logbook at the time of payment of wages, and
    also before a competent authority on the hearing of any complaint
    or question about the payment of wages.

    Sec. 10504. Wages

-STATUTE-
      (a) After the beginning of a voyage, a seaman is entitled to
    receive from the master, on demand, one-half of the balance of
    wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or
    delivers cargo during the voyage. A demand may not be made before
    the expiration of 5 days from the beginning of the voyage, not more
    than once in 5 days, and not more than once in the same port on the
    same entry. If a master does not comply with this subsection, the
    seaman is released from the agreement required by section 10502 of
    this title and is entitled to payment of all wages earned.
    Notwithstanding a release signed by a seaman under section 10312 of
    this title, a court having jurisdiction may set aside, for good
    cause shown, the release and take action that justice requires.
    This subsection does not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a
    yacht.
      (b) The master shall pay a seaman the balance of wages due the
    seaman within 2 days after the termination of the agreement
    required by section 10502 of this title or when the seaman is
    discharged, whichever is earlier.
      (c)(1) Subject to subsection (d), and except as provided in
    paragraph (2), when payment is not made as provided under
    subsection (b) of this section without sufficient cause, the master
    or owner shall pay to the seaman 2 days' wages for each day payment
    is delayed.
      (2) The total amount required to be paid under paragraph (1) with
    respect to all claims in a class action suit by seamen on a
    passenger vessel capable of carrying more than 500 passengers for
    wages under this section against a vessel master, owner, or
    operator or the employer of the seamen shall not exceed ten times
    the unpaid wages that are the subject of the claims.
      (3) A class action suit for wages under this subsection must be
    commenced within three years after the later of - 
        (A) the date of the end of the last voyage for which the wages
      are claimed; or
        (B) the receipt, by a seaman who is a claimant in the suit, of
      a payment of wages that are the subject of the suit that is made
      in the ordinary course of employment.

      (d) Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to:
        (1) a vessel engaged in coastwise commerce.
        (2) a yacht.
        (3) a fishing vessel.
        (4) a whaling vessel.

      (e) This section applies to a seaman on a foreign vessel when in
    harbor of the United States. The courts are available to the seaman
    for the enforcement of this section.
      (f) Deposits in Seaman Account. - On written request signed by
    the seaman, a seaman employed on a passenger vessel capable of
    carrying more than 500 passengers may authorize, the master, owner,
    or operator of the vessel, or the employer of the seaman, to make
    deposits of wages of the seaman into a checking, savings,
    investment, or retirement account, or other account to secure a
    payroll or debit card for the seaman if - 
        (1) the wages designated by the seaman for such deposit are
      deposited in a United States or international financial
      institution designated by the seaman;
        (2) such deposits in the financial institution are fully
      guaranteed under commonly accepted international standards by the
      government of the country in which the financial institution is
      licensed;
        (3) a written wage statement or pay stub, including an
      accounting of any direct deposit, is delivered to the seaman no
      less often than monthly; and
        (4) while on board the vessel on which the seaman is employed,
      the seaman is able to arrange for withdrawal of all funds on
      deposit in the account in which the wages are deposited.

    Sec. 10902. Complaints of unfitness

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) If the chief and second mates or a majority of the crew of
    a vessel ready to begin a voyage discover, before the vessel leaves
    harbor, that the vessel is unfit as to crew, hull, equipment,
    tackle, machinery, apparel, furniture, provisions of food or water,
    or stores to proceed on the intended voyage and require the
    unfitness to be inquired into, the master immediately shall apply
    to the district court of the United States at the place at which
    the vessel is located, or, if no court is being held at the place
    at which the vessel is located, to a judge or justice of the peace,
    for the appointment of surveyors. At least 2 complaining seamen
    shall accompany the master to the judge or justice of the peace.
      (2) A master failing to comply with this subsection is liable to
    the United States Government for a civil penalty of $500.
      (b)(1) Any 3 seamen of a vessel may complain that the provisions
    of food or water for the crew are, at any time, of bad quality,
    unfit for use, or deficient in quantity. The complaint may be made
    to the Secretary, commanding officer of a United States naval
    vessel, consular officer, or chief official of the Customs Service.
      (2) The Secretary, officer, or official shall examine, or have
    examined, the provisions of food or water. If the provisions are
    found to be of bad quality, unfit for use, or deficient in
    quantity, the person making the findings shall certify to the
    master of the vessel which provisions are of bad quality, unfit for
    use, or deficient.
      (3) The Secretary, officer, or official to whom the complaint was
    made shall - 
        (A) make an entry in the official logbook of the vessel on the
      results of the examination; and
        (B) submit a report on the examination to the district court of
      the United States at which the vessel is to arrive, with the
      report being admissible into evidence in any legal proceeding.

      (4) The master is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of
    not more than $100 each time the master, on receiving the
    certification referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection - 
        (A) does not provide other proper provisions of food or water,
      when available, in place of the provisions certified as of bad
      quality or unfit for use;
        (B) does not obtain sufficient provisions when the
      certification includes a finding of a deficiency in quantity; or
        (C) uses provisions certified to be of bad quality or unfit for
      use.

-STATUTE-
      (a) On application made under section 10902(a) of this title, the
    judge or justice of the peace shall appoint 3 experienced and
    skilled marine surveyors to examine the vessel for the defects or
    insufficiencies complained of. The surveyors have the authority to
    receive and consider evidence necessary to evaluate the complaint.
    When the complaint involves provisions of food or water, one of the
    surveyors shall be a medical officer of the Public Health Service,
    if available. The surveyors shall make a report in writing, signed
    by at least 2 of them, stating whether the vessel is fit to proceed
    to sea or, if not, in what respect it is unfit, making appropriate
    recommendations about additional seamen, provisions, or stores, or
    about physical repairs, alterations, or additions necessary to make
    the vessel fit.
      (b) On receiving the report, the judge or justice of the peace
    shall endorse on the report the judgment of the judge or justice on
    whether the vessel is fit to proceed on the voyage, and, if not,
    whether the vessel may proceed to another port at which the
    deficiencies can be corrected. The master and the crew shall comply
    with the judgment.
      (c) The master shall pay all costs of the survey, report, and
    judgment. However, if the complaint of the crew appears in the
    report and judgment to have been without foundation, or if the
    complaint involved provisions of food or water, without reasonable
    grounds, the master or owner may deduct the amount of the costs and
    reasonable damages for the detention of the vessel, as determined
    by the judge or justice of the peace, from the wages of the
    complaining seamen.
      (d) A master of a vessel violating this section who refuses to
    pay the costs and wages is liable to the United States Government
    for a civil penalty of $100 and is liable in damages to each person
    injured by the refusal.

-STATUTE-
      When a survey is made at a foreign port, the surveyors shall
    state in the report whether, in their opinion, the vessel had been
    sent to sea unsuitably provided in any important particular, by
    neglect or design or through mistake or accident. If by neglect or
    design, and the consular officer approves the finding, the officer
    shall discharge a seaman requesting discharge and shall require the
    master to pay one month's wages to that seaman in addition to wages
    then due, or sufficient money for the return of the seaman to the
    nearest and most convenient port of the United States, whichever is
    the greater amount.

-STATUTE-
      (a) On a merchant vessel of the United States the construction of
    which began after March 4, 1915 (except a yacht, pilot vessel, or
    vessel of less than 100 gross tons as measured under section 14502
    of this title, or an alternate tonnage measured under section 14302
    of this title as prescribed by the Secretary under section 14104 of
    this title) - 
        (1) each place appropriated to the crew of the vessel shall
      have a space of at least 120 cubic feet and at least 16 square
      feet, measured on the floor or deck of that place, for each
      seaman or apprentice lodged in the vessel;
        (2) each seaman shall have a separate berth and not more than
      one berth shall be placed one above another;
        (3) the place or berth shall be securely constructed, properly
      lighted, drained, heated, and ventilated, properly protected from
      weather and sea, and, as far as practicable, properly shut off
      and protected from the effluvium of cargo or bilge water; and
        (4) crew space shall be kept free from goods or stores that are
      not the personal property of the crew occupying the place in use
      during the voyage.

      (b) In addition to the requirements of subsection (a) of this
    section, a merchant vessel of the United States that in the
    ordinary course of trade makes a voyage of more than 3 days'
    duration between ports and carries a crew of at least 12 seamen
    shall have a hospital compartment, suitably separated from other
    spaces. The compartment shall have at least one bunk for each 12
    seamen constituting the crew (but not more than 6 bunks may be

      (c) A steam vessel of the United States operating on the
    Mississippi River or its tributaries shall provide, under the
    direction and approval of the Secretary, an appropriate place for
    the crew that shall conform to the requirements of this section, as
    far as they apply to the steam vessel, by providing a properly
    heated sleeping room in the engineroom of the steam vessel properly
    protected from the cold, wind, and rain by means of suitable
    awnings or screens on either side of the guards or sides and
    forward, reaching from the boiler deck to the lower or main deck.
      (d) A merchant vessel of the United States, the construction of
    which began after March 4, 1915, having more than 10 seamen on
    deck, shall have at least one lighted, clean, and properly heated
    and ventilated washing place. There shall be provided at least one
    washing outfit for each 2 seamen of the watch. A separate washing
    place shall be provided for the fireroom and engineroom seamen, if
    their number is more than 10, that shall be large enough to
    accommodate at least one-sixth of them at the same time, and have a
    hot and cold water supply and a sufficient number of washbasins,
    sinks, and shower baths.
      (e) Forecastles shall be fumigated at intervals provided by
    regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services, with the approval of the Secretary, and shall have at
    least 2 exits, one of which may be used in emergencies.
      (f) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or
    licensed individual of a vessel not complying with this section is
    liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of at
    least $50 but not more than $500.

-STATUTE-
      (a) A consular officer shall provide, for a destitute seaman of
    the United States, subsistence and passage to a port of the United
    States in the most reasonable manner, at the expense of the United
    States Government and subject to regulations prescribed by the
    Secretary of State. A seaman, if able, shall be required to perform
    duties on the vessel giving the seaman passage, in accordance with
    the seaman's rating.
      (b) A master of a vessel of the United States bound to a port of
    the United States shall take a destitute seaman on board at the
    request of a consular officer and transport the seaman to the
    United States. A master refusing to transport a destitute seaman
    when requested is liable to the United States Government for a
    civil penalty of $100. The certificate signed and sealed by a
    consular officer is prima facie evidence of refusal. A master is
    not required to carry a destitute seaman if the seaman's presence
    would cause the number of individuals on board to exceed the number
    permitted in the certificate of inspection or if the seaman has a
    contagious disease.
      (c) Compensation for the transportation of destitute seamen to
    the United States who are unable to work shall be agreed on by the
    master and the consular officer, under regulations prescribed by
    the Secretary of State. However, the compensation may be not more
    than the lowest passenger rate of the vessel, or 2 cents a mile,
    whichever is less.
      (d) When a master of a vessel of the United States takes on board
    a destitute seaman unable to work, from a port or place not having
    a consular officer, for transportation to the United States or to a
    port at which there is a consular officer, the master or owner of
    the vessel shall be compensated reasonably under regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary of State.

    Sec. 11106. Wages on justifiable complaint of seamen

-STATUTE-
      (a) Before a seaman on a vessel of the United States is
    discharged in a foreign country by a consular officer on the
    seaman's complaint that the agreement required by this part has
    been breached because the vessel is badly provisioned or
    unseaworthy, or against the officers for cruel treatment, the
    officer shall inquire about the complaint. If satisfied of the
    justice of the complaint, the consular officer shall require the
    master to pay the wages due the seaman plus one month's additional
    wages and shall discharge the seaman. The master shall provide the
    seaman with employment on another vessel or provide the seaman with
    passage on another vessel to the port of original engagement, to
    the most convenient port of the United States, or to some port
    agreeable to the seaman.
      (b) When a vessel does not have sufficient provisions for the
    intended voyage, and the seaman has been forced to accept a reduced
    ration or provisions that are bad in quality or unfit for use, the
    seaman is entitled to recover from the master or owner an
    allowance, as additional wages, that the court hearing the case
    considers reasonable.
      (c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply when the
    reduction in rations was for a period during which the seaman
    willfully and without sufficient cause failed to perform duties or
    was lawfully under confinement on board or on shore for misconduct,
    unless that reduction can be shown to have been unreasonable.
      (d) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to a fishing or
    whaling vessel or a yacht.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Withholding. - Wages due or accruing to a master or seaman on
    a vessel in the foreign, coastwise, intercoastal, interstate, or
    noncontiguous trade or an individual employed on a fishing vessel
    or any fish processing vessel may not be withheld under the tax
    laws of a State or a political subdivision of a State. However,
    this section does not prohibit withholding wages of a seaman on a
    vessel in the coastwise trade between ports in the same State if
    the withholding is under a voluntary agreement between the seaman
    and the employer of the seaman.
      (b) Liability. - 
        (1) Limitation on jurisdiction to tax. - An individual to whom
      this subsection applies is not subject to the income tax laws of
      a State or political subdivision of a State, other than the State
      and political subdivision in which the individual resides, with
      respect to compensation for the performance of duties described
      in paragraph (2).
        (2) Application. - This subsection applies to an individual - 
          (A) engaged on a vessel to perform assigned duties in more
        than one State as a pilot licensed under section 7101 of this
        title or licensed or authorized under the laws of a State; or
          (B) who performs regularly assigned duties while engaged as a
        master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on navigable
        waters in 2 or more States.

    a court about the payment by a master or seaman of any part of the
    master's or seaman's wages for the support and maintenance of the
    spouse or minor children of the master or seaman, or both. A
    payment of wages to a master or seaman is valid, notwithstanding
    any prior sale or assignment of wages or any attachment,
    encumbrance, or arrestment of the wages.
      (b) An assignment or sale of wages or salvage made before the
    payment of wages does not bind the party making it, except
    allotments authorized by section 10315 of this title.
      (c) This section applies to an individual employed on a fishing

-STATUTE-
      (a) Money, property, and wages forfeited under this chapter for

    transferred to the appropriate district court of the United States
    when the voyage is completed.

    imposed properly, the property transferred may be sold in the same
    manner prescribed for the disposition of the property of deceased
    seamen. The court shall deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous
    receipts the proceeds of the sale and any money and wages
    transferred to the court.
      (c) When an owner or master fails to transfer the balance as
    required under subsection (a) of this section, the owner or master
    is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of 2
    times the amount of the balance, recoverable by the Secretary in
    the same manner that seaman's wages are recovered.
      (d) In all other cases of forfeiture of wages, the forfeiture
    shall be for the benefit of the owner of the vessel.

      The words "The Secretary of Transportation may issue a
    certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement" and
    "when purchased by a citizen or citizens of the United States" are
    omitted as unnecessary because section 12112, as revised by the
    bill, provides the requirements for a wrecked vessel to obtain a
    coastwise endorsement.
      In subsection (c)(1), the words "or her possessions" are omitted
    as unnecessary because of the definition of "United States" in
    chapter 1 of the revised title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 12111. Registry endorsement

-STATUTE-
      (a) Requirements. - A registry endorsement may be issued for a
    vessel that satisfies the requirements of section 12103 of this
    title.
      (b) Authorized Activity. - A vessel for which a registry
    endorsement is issued may engage in foreign trade or trade with
    Guam, American Samoa, Wake, Midway, or Kingman Reef.
      (c) Certain Vessels Owned by Trusts. - 
        (1) Nonapplication of beneficiary citizenship requirement. -
      For the issuance of a certificate of documentation with only a
      registry endorsement, the beneficiaries of a trust are not
      required to be citizens of the United States if the trust
      qualifies under paragraph (2) and the vessel is subject to a
      charter to a citizen of the United States.
        (2) Requirements for trust to qualify. - 
          (A) In general. - Subject to subparagraph (B), a trust
        qualifies under this paragraph with respect to a vessel only if
        - 
            (i) each trustee is a citizen of the United States; and
            (ii) the application for documentation of the vessel
          includes the affidavit of each trustee stating that the
          trustee is not aware of any reason involving a beneficiary of
          the trust that is not a citizen of the United States, or
          involving any other person that is not a citizen of the
          United States, as a result of which the beneficiary or other
          person would hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate power
          to influence or limit the exercise of the authority of the
          trustee with respect to matters involving any ownership or
          operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the
          interests of the United States.

          (B) Authority of non-citizens. - If any person that is not a
        citizen of the United States has authority to direct or
        participate in directing a trustee for a trust in matters
        involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may
        adversely affect the interests of the United States or in
        removing a trustee for a trust without cause, either directly
        or indirectly through the control of another person, the trust
        is not qualified under this paragraph unless the trust
        instrument provides that persons who are not citizens of the
        United States may not hold more than 25 percent of the
        aggregate authority to so direct or remove a trustee.
          (C) Ownership by non-citizens. - Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do
        not prohibit a person that is not a citizen of the United
        States from holding more than 25 percent of the beneficial
        interest in a trust.

        (3) Citizenship of person chartering vessel. - If a person
      chartering a vessel from a trust that qualifies under paragraph
      (2) is a citizen of the United States under section 50501 of this
      title, the vessel is deemed to be owned by a citizen of the
      United States for purposes of that section and related laws,
      except chapter 531 of this title.

      (d) Activities Involving Mobile Offshore Drilling Units. - 
        (1) In general. - Only a vessel for which a certificate of
      documentation with a registry endorsement is issued may engage in
      - 
          (A) the setting, relocation, or recovery of the anchors or
        other mooring equipment of a mobile offshore drilling unit that
        is located over the outer Continental Shelf (as defined in
        section 2(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43
        U.S.C. 1331(a))); or
          (B) the transportation of merchandise or personnel to or from
        a point in the United States from or to a mobile offshore
        drilling unit located over the outer Continental Shelf that is
        not attached to the seabed.

        (2) Coastwise trade not authorized. - Nothing in paragraph (1)
      authorizes the employment in the coastwise trade of a vessel that
      does not meet the requirements of section 12112 of this title.

      engage in the fisheries.

      (b) Authorized Activity. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to the laws of the United States
      regulating the fisheries, a vessel for which a fishery
      endorsement is issued may engage in the fisheries.
        (2) Use by prohibited persons. - A fishery endorsement is
      invalid immediately if the vessel for which it is issued is used
      as a fishing vessel while it is chartered or leased to an
      individual who is not a citizen of the United States or to an
      entity that is not eligible to own a vessel with a fishery
      endorsement.

      (c) Ownership Requirements for Entities. - 
        (1) In general. - A vessel owned by an entity is eligible for a
      fishery endorsement only if at least 75 percent of the interest
      in the entity, at each tier of ownership and in the aggregate, is
      owned and controlled by citizens of the United States.
        (2) Determining 75 percent interest. - In determining whether
      at least 75 percent of the interest in the entity is owned and
      controlled by citizens of the United States under paragraph (1),
      the Secretary shall apply section 50501(d) of this title, except
      that for this purpose the terms "control" or "controlled" - 
          (A) include the right to - 
            (i) direct the business of the entity;
            (ii) limit the actions of or replace the chief executive
          officer, a majority of the board of directors, any general
          partner, or any person serving in a management capacity of
          the entity; or
            (iii) direct the transfer, operation, or manning of a
          vessel with a fishery endorsement; but

          (B) do not include the right to simply participate in the
        activities under subparagraph (A), or the exercise of rights
        under loan or mortgage covenants by a mortgagee eligible to be
        a preferred mortgagee under section 31322(a) of this title,
        except that a mortgagee not eligible to own a vessel with a
        fishery endorsement may only operate such a vessel to the
        extent necessary for the immediate safety of the vessel or for
        repairs, drydocking, or berthing changes.

        (3) Exceptions. - This subsection does not apply to a vessel
      when it is engaged in the fisheries in the exclusive economic

      engaged in tuna fishing in the Pacific Ocean outside the
      exclusive economic zone or pursuant to the South Pacific Regional
      Fisheries Treaty, provided that the owner of the vessel continues
      to comply with the eligibility requirements for a fishery
      endorsement under the Federal law that was in effect on October
      1, 1998. A fishery endorsement issued pursuant to this paragraph
      is valid for engaging only in the activities described in this
      paragraph.

      owner of each such vessel shall file a statement of citizenship
      setting forth all relevant facts regarding vessel ownership and
      control with the Administrator on an annual basis to demonstrate
      compliance with those provisions.

      shall conform to the extent practicable with the regulations
      establishing the form of citizenship affidavit set forth in part
      355 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on
      September 25, 1997, except that the form of the statement shall
      be written in a manner to allow the owner of the vessel to
      satisfy any annual renewal requirements for a certificate of
      documentation for the vessel and to comply with this subsection
      and subsections (c) and (d), and shall not be required to be

        time of all, or substantially all, of the living marine
        resources harvested by a fishing vessel.

      (f) Vessels Measuring Less Than 100 Feet. - The Secretary shall
    establish reasonable and necessary requirements to demonstrate

    endorsement issued for that vessel is invalid.
      (h) Revocation of Endorsements. - The Secretary shall revoke the
    fishery endorsement of any vessel subject to subsection (c) or (d)
    whose owner does not comply with those provisions.
      (i) Regulations. - Regulations to implement subsections (c) and
    (d) and sections 12151(c) and 31322(b) of this title shall prohibit
    impermissible transfers of ownership or control, specify any
    transactions that require prior approval of an implementing agency,
    identify transactions that do not require prior agency approval,
    and to the extent practicable, minimize disruptions to the
    commercial fishing industry, to the traditional financing
    arrangements of that industry, and to the opportunity to form
    fishery cooperatives.

      In subsection (b)(1), the word "only" is omitted because section
    12102(a), as revised by the bill, contains a general requirement
    for appropriate documentation to engage in any trade.
      In subsection (c)(1), the word "entity" is substituted for
    "corporation, partnership, association, trust, joint venture,
    limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or any
    other entity" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (e)(3), the words "After October 1, 2001" are
    omitted as obsolete.
      In subsection (i), the first two sentences of section 203(b) of
    Public Law 105-277 are omitted as obsolete.

      The American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105-277, div. C, title II)
    (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B), probably
    should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
    and Management Act (see note below). Subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this
    section was derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this
    title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109-304,
    Sec. 5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491. As part of that amendment,
    the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a
    reference to "such Act" which had been preceded by references to
    both of the above named Acts. See the Historical and Revision Notes
    above and section 2 of Pub. L. 109-304, set out as a Legislative
    Purpose and Construction note preceding section 101 of this title.
      Section 208(g) of the American Fisheries Act, referred to in
    subsec. (d)(2)(C), is section 208(g) of title II of div. C of Pub.
    L. 105-277, Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681-627, which is set out in
    a note under section 1851 of Title 16, Conservation.
      The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act,
    referred to in subsec. (g), is Pub. L. 94-265, Apr. 13, 1976, 90
    Stat. 331, which is classified principally to chapter 38 (Sec. 1801
    et seq.) of Title 16, Conservation. For complete classification of
    this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section
    1801 of Title 16 and Tables.

            "(i) the contract itself; or
            "(ii) a ruling letter by the Coast Guard before July 29,
          1987 under 46 C.F.R. Sec. 67.21-1 or Sec. 67.27-3 pursuant to
          a ruling request evidencing that intent; or
          "(B) is purchased for use as a fish processing vessel under a

            "(i) a contract to rebuild the vessel for use as a fish
          processing vessel was entered into before September 1, 1987;
          and
            "(ii) that vessel is part of a specific business plan
          involving the conversion in foreign shipyards of a series of
          three vessels and rebuilding work on at least one of the
          vessels had begun before July 28, 1987.
      "(b) A vessel rebuilt under subsection (a)(3)(B) or (4) of this
    section must be redelivered to the owner before July 28, 1990.
    However, the Secretary may, on proof of circumstances beyond the

      "(c)(1) Any fishery license or registry issued to a vessel built
    in a foreign country under this section shall be endorsed to

      In this section, the word "Secretary" is substituted for
    "Secretary of the Treasury", thereby incorporating the definition
    of "Secretary" in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the
    Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously
    were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b)
    of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89-670, Oct. 15,
    1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the
    Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again
    transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section
    888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296, Nov.
    25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135).
      In subsection (a)(1), the words "seeking hereunder to document a
    vessel under the laws of the United States or to operate a vessel
    exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States" are
    omitted as unnecessary because of the reorganization of the
    section.
      Subsection (d)(1)(B) is substituted for "together with their
    owners or masters, shall be entitled to all the other benefits and
    privileges and shall be subject to the same requirements,
    penalties, and forfeitures as may be applicable in the case of
    vessels built in the United States and otherwise documented or
    exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States" to
    eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d)(2), the words before subparagraph (A) are
    substituted for "no vessel owned by any such corporation shall
    engage in the fisheries or in the transportation of merchandise or
    passengers for hire between points in the United States, including
    Territories, Districts, and possessions thereof, embraced within
    the coastwise laws, except" to eliminate unnecessary words. See the
    definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

    provisions from which this section was derived], and any
    regulations published after February 4, 2004, with respect to
    coastwise endorsements, shall not apply to a certificate of

    12119(b), (d)-(f)] of title 46, United States Code, or a
    replacement vessel of a similar size and function, that was issued
    prior to the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 9, 2004] as long
    as the vessel is owned by the person named therein, or by a
    subsidiary or affiliate of that person, and the controlling
    interest in such owner has not been transferred to a person that

    States Code, as that section was in effect on the date of enactment
    of this Act) with a certificate of documentation endorsed with a
    coastwise endorsement as of the date of enactment of this Act, and
    the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating shall revoke any such certificate if the vessel does not
    by then meet the requirements of section 12106(e) of title 46,

          "(i) the vessel described in paragraph (1) is unavailable for
        more than 180 days due to an act of God or a marine casualty;
        or
          "(ii) a contract to purchase or construct such replacement
        vessel is executed not later than December 31, 2004."

    12106(f)(3)(A)(iii) [now section 12119(c)(3)(A)(iii)] of title 46,
    United States Code, for a vessel if the person that owns the vessel
    (or, if the vessel is owned by a trust or similar arrangement, the
    beneficiary of the trust or similar arrangement) notifies the
    Secretary that circumstances beyond the direct control of such
    person or its affiliates prevent, or reasonably threaten to
    prevent, such person from satisfying such requirement, and the
    Secretary does not, with good cause, determine otherwise. The
    waiver or reduction shall apply during the period of time that such
    circumstances exist."

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - To ensure compliance with this chapter and laws
    governing the qualifications of vessels to engage in the coastwise
    trade and the fisheries, the Secretary may require owners, masters,
    charterers, and mortgagees of documented vessels to submit reports
    in any reasonable form and manner the Secretary may prescribe.
      (b) Vessels Rebuilt Outside United States. - 
        (1) In general. - Under regulations prescribed by the
      Secretary, if a vessel exceeding the tonnage specified in
      paragraph (2) and documented or last documented under the laws of
      the United States is rebuilt outside the United States, the owner
      or master shall submit a report of the rebuilding to the
      Secretary.
        (2) Tonnage. - The tonnage referred to in paragraph (1) is - 
          (A) 500 gross tons as measured under section 14502 of this
        title; or
          (B) an alternate tonnage as measured under section 14302 of
        this title as prescribed by the Secretary under section 14104

      the United States, the report shall be submitted when the
      rebuilding is completed. If the rebuilding is completed outside
      the United States, the report shall be submitted when the vessel
      first arrives at a port in the customs territory of the United
      States.

      In subsection (b)(1), the word "Secretary" is substituted for
    "Secretary of the Treasury", thereby incorporating the definition
    of "Secretary" in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the
    Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously
    were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b)
    of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89-670, Oct. 15,
    1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the
    Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again
    transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section
    888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296, Nov.
    25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135). The words "rebuilt outside the United
    States" are substituted for "and any part of the rebuilding,
    including the construction of major components of the hull and
    superstructure of the vessel, is not effected within the United
    States, its Territories (not including trust territories) or its
    possessions" because of the definition of "rebuilt" in section
    12101, and the definition of "United States" in chapter 1, of the
    revised title.

    substance of the amendment by Pub. L. 109-241, Sec. 308, into this
    section by substituting "charterers, and mortgagees" for "and
    charterers". See 2006 Amendment note below and section 18(a) of

      In subsection (b), in restating 46 App. U.S.C. 883a (2d, last
    sentences), the penalty of $200 for the owner and master of the
    vessel is omitted because subsection (a) provides a general civil
    penalty for violation of this chapter. The authority to remit or
    mitigate a penalty under section 2107(b) is omitted because section
    2107(b) applies to subtitle II and this section is in subtitle II.

    Sec. 12302. Standard numbering system

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation a standard
    numbering system for vessels to which this chapter applies. On
    application by a State, the Secretary shall approve a State
    numbering system that is consistent with the standard numbering
    system. In carrying out its numbering system, a State shall adopt
    any definitions of relevant terms prescribed by regulations of the
    Secretary.
      (b) A State with an approved numbering system is the issuing
    authority within the meaning of this chapter. The Secretary is the
    issuing authority in a State in which a State numbering system has
    not been approved.
      (c) When a vessel is numbered in a State, it is deemed in
    compliance with the numbering system of a State in which it
    temporarily is operated.
      (d) When a vessel is removed to a new State of principal
    operation, the issuing authority of that State shall recognize the
    validity of the number issued by the original State for 60 days.
      (e) If a State has a numbering system approved after the
    Secretary issues a number, the State shall recognize the validity
    of the number issued by the Secretary for one year.
      (f) When the Secretary decides that a State numbering system is
    not being carried out consistent with the standard numbering system
    or the State has changed the system without the Secretary's
    approval, the Secretary may withdraw approval after giving notice
    to the State, in writing, stating the reasons for the withdrawal.

      Section 12302 provides for a standard numbering system for
    undocumented vessels and for approval of State numbering systems by
    the Secretary. It also requires that a State, when implementing its
    numbering system, adopt any relevant terms required by the
    Secretary. In States without approved numbering systems, the
    Federal Government issues the numbers. This section also provides
    for the operation of a vessel in a State other than the one in
    which it was numbered.

    noncommercial operation of less than 7 days may be retained on
    shore by the vessel's owner or representative at the place from
    which the vessel departs or returns to the possession of the owner
    or the owner's representative. A vessel that does not have the
    certificate of number on board shall be identified when in
    operation, and comply with requirements, as the issuing authority
    prescribes.
      (b) The owner of a vessel numbered under this chapter shall
    provide - 
        (1) the issuing authority notice of the transfer of any part of
      the owner's interest in the vessel or of the destruction or
      abandonment of the vessel, within a reasonable time after the
      transfer, destruction, or abandonment; and
        (2) notice of a change of address within a reasonable time of
      the change, as prescribed by regulation.

    title, and titled under the law of a State. The information is
    available under section 12503 for use by the public, similarly
    under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.
      Subsection (b) lists the vessel identification information which
    is required to be maintained by the Secretary. The Secretary has
    the authority to prescribe other information to be maintained in
    addition to the items listed. For example, the Secretary may
    identify vessels issued fisheries permits by the Department of
    Commerce. The Secretary may also monitor transactions involving
    vessels that require approval by the Secretary under section 9 of
    the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) before interest or
    control in the vessel may be transferred to a noncitizen.
      Subsection (c) clarifies that the Secretary has the flexibility
    to maintain this system in connection with any other information
    system maintained by the Secretary, including the Federal Aviation
    Administration system containing aircraft ownership information.
    This would also permit the Secretary to combine various systems and
    data bases maintained by the Secretary such as documentation and
    numbering of vessels, and safety, casualty, and law enforcement
    statistics.

      Revised section 12502
      Subsection (a) of this section requires the Secretary to maintain
    a unique numbering system for vessels of the United States. The
    Secretary may use existing vessel numbering systems such as the
    hull identification number for this purpose, but must ensure that
    no two existing vessels of the United States have the same number.
    The Secretary should consider and propose the use of a 17-digit
    number to implement this requirement. This subsection also requires
    the Secretary to maintain a system of signal letters and to record
    vessel names for documented vessels. The Secretary is authorized to
    establish other vessel identification markings for vessels of the
    United States, such as hailing ports.
      Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) contain other requirements and
    restrictions concerning vessel identification markings.
      This section consolidates the requirements of sections 12114,
    12115, 12116, and 12118 of title 46. For this reason, section 106
    of this bill repeals those sections.

      Revised section 12503
      Subsection (a) of section 12503 allows a State or approved State
    delegee to make vessel identification information available to the
    Secretary. Participation in the system is voluntary on the part of
    a State. A benefit to boat purchasers and financiers in States with
    approved titling systems participating in this system is that
    vessel mortgages or financing instruments made in those States are
    deemed to be preferred mortgages under chapter 313 of title 46,
    United States Code (as codified and enacted by this Act).
      Under subsection (a), the Secretary may prescribe the manner and
    form in which the information is made available by the States. In
    this regard, the Committee intends that the Secretary employ the
    most efficient, up-to-date computer technology in maintaining
    information made available from the States to avoid duplication of
    effort in maintaining information and to reduce the costs of the
    system. In addition to the vessel identification information made
    available by States under paragraphs (1)-(6), the Secretary and a
    State may agree that the State make available other information.
    For example, the purpose for which a vessel is routinely used would
    be valuable information for the system.
      The Committee intends that most of the information in the system
    will become available directly and exclusively from the States to
    the greatest extent possible. However, under subsection (b), the
    Secretary may accept information from others under conditions and
    in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary. Thus, if the
    Secretary discovers a valuable and reliable source of data that can
    be conveniently made available to the system, the Secretary can
    approve it.
      Under paragraph (c)(1), the Secretary must maintain information
    on a State-titled vessel with a preferred mortgage that moves to a
    nonparticipating, nontitle State, until the mortgage is discharged
    or the vessel is sold. Under paragraph (c)(2), the Secretary must
    accept information submitted under section 31321 of title 46 (as
    enacted by this Act) concerning a discharge of a preferred mortgage
    on a vessel title under State law. This would be necessary if the
    vessel moves to a nonparticipating State, and information on that
    vessel would not be provided to the system by that State. This
    subsection will allow the Secretary to keep the vessel information
    system current on these matters and purge files no longer required
    to be maintained.

    However, the Committee firmly expects that information will be made

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   

      Revised section 12505
      This section contains the authority for the Secretary to charge a
    fee under the user charge law, 31 U.S.C. 9701, for providing
    information to or requesting information from the vessel
    identification system. Fees may not be charged under this
    subsection to an agency or a State that is participating in the
    vessel identification system maintained by the Secretary.
      Under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may collect
    an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the owner of a vessel of
    the United States under 31 U.S.C. 9701 for the vessel
    identification system. Since vessel owners will benefit from the
    vessel identification system, such as from documentation of
    ownership data and stolen vessel tracking, this fee is designed as
    a maintenance charge to owners for this service. The collection of
    the annual fee may be delayed by the Secretary, and an agency,
    State, or person may be employed to collect the fee under
    subsection (c). The Committee expects that the Secretary will make
    agreements with States to collect this fee at the time of vessel
    registrations. The term of these registrations varies from one to
    three years as permitted by chapter 123 of title 46.
      Under subsection (d) of this section, if a State is employed to
    collect the fee, the State may retain one-half of the amounts
    collected, and must transfer the remainder to the Secretary. The
    amounts retained by a State may be used to cover the costs of
    making vessel identification information available to the
    Secretary. This includes upgrading or establishing titling systems
    as well as making improvements and other changes to vessel
    numbering systems to make information available. Because States are
    allowed to make improvements to their vessel titling and numbering
    systems with the amounts retained under this section, the costs of
    those programs may decrease. This could result in a corresponding
    decrease in State numbering fees and offset vessel identification
    system fees paid by vessel owners.

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      1990 - Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101-595 redesignated subsec. (e) as
    (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: "In
    addition to any fee under subsection (a) of this section, the
    Secretary may collect an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the
    owner of each vessel of the United States under section 9701 of
    title 31 for maintaining the vessel identification system. However,
    the collection of that fee may be delayed under conditions
    prescribed by the Secretary."

      "(d) If a State is employed to collect a fee under subsection (c)

      In this chapter:
        (1) Eligible State. - The term "eligible State" means a State
      that has a State recreational boating safety program accepted by
      the Secretary.
        (2) State Recreational Boating Safety Program. - The term
      "State recreational boating safety program" means education,
      assistance, and enforcement activities conducted for maritime

      Section 16 of the bill [H.R. 1442, which became Pub. L. 109-304]
    moves the definitions relating to the recreational boating safety
    program from section 2102(a)(1) and (3) to chapter 131 because the
    terms only appear in chapter 131.
      Section 16 of the bill also eliminates the special definitions of
    "State" and "United States" in section 2102(a)(2) as including the
    Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands because the Trust Territory
    has been terminated. See the definitions of "State" and "United
    States" in section 2101, which are being moved to chapter 1 and
    being made applicable title-wide. Those definitions already include
    the Northern Mariana Islands, the only component of the former
    Trust Territory still under United States sovereignty.

-STATUTE-
      (a) To encourage greater State participation and uniformity in
    boating safety efforts, and particularly to permit the States to
    assume the greater share of boating safety education, assistance,
    and enforcement activities, the Secretary shall carry out a
    national recreational boating safety program. Under this program,
    the Secretary shall make contracts with, and allocate and
    distribute amounts to, eligible States to assist them in
    developing, carrying out, and financing State recreational boating
    safety programs.
      (b) The Secretary shall establish guidelines and standards for
    the program. In doing so, the Secretary - 
        (1) shall consider, among other things, factors affecting
      recreational boating safety by contributing to overcrowding and
      congestion of waterways, such as the increasing number of
      recreational vessels operating on those waterways and their
      geographic distribution, the availability and geographic
      distribution of recreational boating facilities in and among
      applying States, and State marine casualty and fatality
      statistics for recreational vessels;
        (2) shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior to
      minimize duplication with the purposes and expenditures of the
      Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-4 -
      460l-11) the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950
      (16 U.S.C. 777-777k), and with the guidelines developed under
      those Acts; and
        (3) shall maintain environmental standards consistent with the
      Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451-1464) and
      other laws and policies of the United States intended to
      safeguard the ecological and esthetic quality of the waters and
      wetlands of the United States.

      (c) A State whose recreational boating safety program has been
    approved by the Secretary is eligible for allocation and
    distribution of amounts under this chapter to assist that State in
    developing, carrying out, and financing its program. Matching
    amounts shall be allocated and distributed among eligible States by
    the Secretary as provided by section 13104 of this title.

    safety program, and the program is eligible to receive amounts
    authorized to be expended under section 13107 of this title, if the

        (3) sufficient patrol and other activity to ensure adequate
      enforcement of applicable State boating safety laws and
      regulations;
        (4) an adequate State boating safety education program, that
      includes the dissemination of information concerning the hazards
      of operating a vessel when under the influence of alcohol or
      drugs; and
        (5) a system, approved by the Secretary, for reporting marine
      casualties required under section 6102 of this title.

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (c), the Secretary
    shall expend in each fiscal year for State recreational boating
    safety programs, under contracts with States under this chapter, an
    amount equal to the sum of (A) the amount made available from the
    Boat Safety Account for that fiscal year under section 15 of the
    Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act and (B) the amount
    transferred to the Secretary under subsections (a)(2) and (f) of
    section 4 of the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act (16
    U.S.C. 777c(a)(2) and (f)). The amount shall be allocated as
    provided under section 13104 of this title and shall be available
    for State recreational boating safety programs as provided under
    the guidelines established under subsection (b) of this section.
    Amounts authorized to be expended for State recreational boating
    safety programs shall remain available until expended and are
    deemed to have been expended only if an amount equal to the total
    amounts authorized to be expended under this section for the fiscal
    year in question and all prior fiscal years have been obligated.
    Amounts previously obligated but released by payment of a final
    voucher or modification of a program acceptance shall be credited
    to the balance of unobligated amounts and are immediately available
    for expenditure.
      (2) The Secretary shall use not more than two percent of the
    amount available each fiscal year for State recreational boating
    safety programs under this chapter to pay the costs of
    investigations, personnel, and activities related to administering
    those programs.
      (b) The Secretary shall establish guidelines prescribing the
    purposes for which amounts available under this chapter for State
    recreational boating safety programs may be used. Those purposes
    shall include - 
        (1) providing facilities, equipment, and supplies for boating
      safety education and law enforcement, including purchase,
      operation, maintenance, and repair;
        (2) training personnel in skills related to boating safety and
      to the enforcement of boating safety laws and regulations;
        (3) providing public boating safety education, including
      educational programs and lectures, to the boating community and
      the public school system;
        (4) acquiring, constructing, or repairing public access sites
      used primarily by recreational boaters;
        (5) conducting boating safety inspections and marine casualty
      investigations;
        (6) establishing and maintaining emergency or search and rescue
      facilities, and providing emergency or search and rescue
      assistance;
        (7) establishing and maintaining waterway markers and other
      appropriate aids to navigation; and
        (8) providing State recreational vessel numbering and titling
      programs.

      (c)(1) Of the amount transferred to the Secretary under
    subsection (a)(2) of section 4 of the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish
    Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 777c(a)(2)), $5,500,000 is available to
    the Secretary for payment of expenses of the Coast Guard for
    personnel and activities directly related to coordinating and
    carrying out the national recreational boating safety program under
    this title, of which not less than $2,000,000 shall be available to
    the Secretary only to ensure compliance with chapter 43 of this
    title.
      (2) No funds available to the Secretary under this subsection may
    be used to replace funding traditionally provided through general
    appropriations, nor for any purposes except those purposes
    authorized by this section.
      (3) Amounts made available by this subsection shall remain
    available during the 2 succeeding fiscal years. Any amount that is
    unexpended or unobligated at the end of the 3-year period during
    which it is available shall be withdrawn by the Secretary and
    allocated to the States in addition to any other amounts available
    for allocation in the fiscal year in which they are withdrawn or
    the following fiscal year.
      (4) The Secretary shall publish annually in the Federal Register
    a detailed accounting of the projects, programs, and activities
    funded under this subsection.

      requirements

-STATUTE-
      (a) Amounts allocated and distributed under section 13104 of this
    title shall be computed and paid to the States as follows:
        (1) During the second quarter of a fiscal year and on the basis
      of computations made under section 13106 of this title and
      submitted by the States for the preceding fiscal year, the
      Secretary shall determine the percentage of the amounts available
      to which each eligible State is entitled for the next fiscal
      year.
        (2) Notice of the percentage and of the dollar amount, if it
      can be determined, for each State shall be provided to the States
      at the earliest practicable time.
        (3) If the Secretary determines that an amount made available
      to a State for a prior fiscal year is greater or less than the
      amount that should have been made available to the State for the
      prior fiscal year, because of later or more accurate State
      expenditure information, the amount for the current fiscal year
      may be increased or decreased by the appropriate amount.

      (b) The Secretary shall schedule the payment of amounts,
    consistent with the program purposes and applicable regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to minimize the time
    elapsing between the transfer of amounts from the Treasury and the
    subsequent disbursement of the amounts by a State.
      (c) The Secretary shall notify a State authority or agency that
    further payments will be made to the State only when the program
    complies with the prescribed standards or a failure to comply
    substantially with standards is corrected if the Secretary, after
    reasonable notice to the designated State authority or agency,
    finds that - 
        (1) the State recreational boating safety program submitted by
      the State and accepted by the Secretary has been so changed that
      it no longer complies with this chapter or standards prescribed
      by regulations; or
        (2) in carrying out the State recreational boating safety
      program, there has been a failure to comply substantially with
      the standards prescribed by regulations.

      (d) The Secretary shall provide for the accounting, budgeting,
    and other fiscal procedures that are necessary and reasonable to
    carry out this section properly and efficiently. Records related to
    amounts allocated under this chapter shall be made available to the
    Secretary and the Comptroller General to conduct audits.

      Part J contains provisions that apply to the measurement of a
    vessel to determine its tonnage. Tonnage is a measurement of a
    vessel's volume and is used for international, customs, and
    regulatory purposes. This part implements the 1969 International
    Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships and provides a framework
    for phasing in the international system as the method of measuring
    ships domestically, to establish uniformity in ship measurement.
    The availability of an alternate domestic regulatory system of
    measurement is continued so that the application of domestic laws
    will be preserved in order that vessels engaged in domestic
    commerce will not be adversely affected.

      Revised section 14103
      Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.
      Section 14103(a) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a
    qualified person the authority to measure a vessel and issue an
    International Tonnage Certificate or other certificate of
    measurement. The term "qualified person" means an organization that
    the Secretary believes has the necessary qualifications to measure
    a vessel competently, such as the American Bureau of Shipping.
      The conferees intend that in section 14103 the term "qualified
    person" includes not only organizations that the Secretary finds to
    be qualified to perform measurement duties, but any person as that
    term is defined in section 1 of title 1, United States Code
    (including individuals), that the Secretary determines qualified to
    perform measurement duties. The House and Senate conferees also
    agree that, where authorized, in addition to information required
    by the Secretary, regulatory tonnage should be used on all
    certificates and documents related to a vessel unless the owner
    otherwise requests.
      Section 14103(b) provides for the appeal to the Secretary of a
    decision made by a person that has received delegated authority.
    This ensures that the Secretary has full oversight of delegated
    tonnage measurement functions.
      Section 14103(c) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a
    country that is a party to the International Convention on Tonnage
    Measurement of Ships, 1969, the authority to measure a vessel and
    issue an International Tonnage Certificate.
      Section 14103(d) clarifies the Secretary's authority to revoke at
    any time and without cause a delegation of authority to measure a
    vessel or issue a certificate. This authority is given so that no
    delay occurs administratively in revoking a delegation wherever the
    Secretary decides a revocation is warranted.

    Any such regulation shall be considered to be an interpretive
    regulation for purposes of section 553 of title 5. Until an
    alternate tonnage is prescribed, the statutorily established
    tonnage shall apply to vessels measured under chapter 143 or
    chapter 145 of this title.
      (c) The head of each Federal agency shall ensure that regulations
    issued by the agency that specify particular tonnages comply with

    Sec. 14301. Application

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, this chapter
    applies to any vessel for which the application of an international
    agreement or other law of the United States to the vessel depends
    on the vessel's tonnage.
      (b) This chapter does not apply to the following:
        (1) a vessel of war, unless the government of the country to
      which the vessel belongs elects to measure the vessel under this
      chapter.
        (2) a vessel of less than 24 meters (79 feet) overall in
      length.
        (3) a vessel of United States or Canadian registry or
      nationality, or a vessel operated under the authority of the
      United States or Canada, and that is operating only on the Great
      Lakes, unless the owner requests.
        (4) a vessel of United States registry or nationality, or one
      operated under the authority of the United States (except a
      vessel that engages on a foreign voyage) the keel of which was
      laid or that was at a similar stage of construction before
      January 1, 1986, unless - 
          (A) the owner requests; or
          (B) the vessel undergoes a change that the Secretary finds
        substantially affects the vessel's gross tonnage.

        (5) a barge of United States registry or nationality, or a
      barge operated under the authority of the United States (except a
      barge that engages on a foreign voyage) unless the owner
      requests.

      (c) An existing vessel that has not undergone a change that the
    Secretary finds substantially affects the vessel's gross tonnage
    (or a vessel to which IMO Resolutions A.494 (XII) of November 19,
    1981, A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, or A.541 (XIII) of
    November 17, 1983, apply) may retain its tonnages existing on July
    18, 1994, for the application of relevant requirements under
    international agreements (except the Convention) and other laws of
    the United States. However, if the vessel undergoes a change
    substantially affecting its tonnage after July 18, 1994, the vessel
    shall be remeasured under this chapter.
      (d) This chapter does not affect an international agreement to
    which the United States Government is a party that is not in
    conflict with the Convention or the application of IMO Resolutions
    A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981, A.540 (XIII) of November 17,
    1983, and A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983.

      Revised section 14301
      Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.
      Section 14301 delineates which vessels must be measured in
    compliance with the standards of the Convention.
      Section 14301(a) provides that a vessel must be measured under
    the standards of the Convention if it is documented or required by
    law to be documented under chapter 121 of this subtitle or if it is
    engaged on a foreign voyage, unless the vessel is specifically
    exempted under section 14301(b).
      Section 14301(b) provides the following exemptions from the
    requirement in section 14301(a) to be measured under the
    Convention:
        1. A vessel of war;
        2. A vessel of less than 24 meters (79 feet) overall in length
      ("overall in length" is defined in section 2101);
        3. A vessel that operates only on the Great Lakes (although the
      owner may request that it be measured under the Convention);
        4. A vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of
      construction before January 1, 1986, and is on a domestic voyage,
      unless the vessel undergoes a change that significantly changes
      its tonnage or the owner requests that the vessel be measured
      under the Convention; and
        5. A vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of
      construction before July 18, 1982, unless the vessel undergoes a
      change that significantly changes the vessel's tonnage or the
      owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention.
      Together, subsections (b)(4) and (5) provide that, unless the
    owner requests measurement under the Convention, unaltered vessels
    built before 1986 engaging only on domestic voyages do not have to
    be measured under the Convention or use Convention measurement for
    the application of any domestic laws. Further, these subsections
    provide that unaltered vessels that are built before July 18, 1982,
    engaging on foreign voyages do not have to be measured under the
    Convention until 1994 and are not required to use Convention
    measurement as a basis for the application of any domestic laws.
      Section 14301(c) provides that if a vessel owner requests that
    the vessel be measured under the Convention, the vessel may only be
    remeasured under the Convention.
      Section 14301(d) provides that after July 18, 1994, a vessel
    whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction
    before July 18, 1982 may retain its regulatory tonnage for the
    application of requirements under U.S. laws or international
    agreements, except the International Convention on Tonnage
    Measurement of Ships. However, if the vessel was not required to be
    measured under the Convention, but the vessel's owner requested
    that the vessel be measured under the Convention system before July
    19, 1994, or if the vessel undergoes a change affecting its
    tonnage, the vessel may not use its regulatory tonnage for the
    application of U.S. laws or international agreements after July 19,
    1994.
      Section 14301(e) provides that this chapter does not affect any
    international agreement to which the United States is a party that
    is not in conflict with the International Convention on Tonnage
    Measurement of Ships, 1969. It further provides that this chapter
    does not affect the application of the three interim schemes of the

      subsection, consult with representatives of the private sector
      having experience with the operation of vessels likely to be
      affected by laws of the United States whose application is based
      on tonnage; and

      Section 14302(a) requires the Secretary to measure a vessel to
    which this chapter applies, in the way provided by this chapter and
    by the Convention. Section 14302(b) provides that a vessel that is
    required to be measured under this chapter can not also be required
    to be measured under another law. The exception allows the Panama
    Canal Commission to continue to use the Canal measurement system
    for calculation of tolls. Section 14302(c) provides that the
    applicability of tonnage-based laws that become effective after
    July 18, 1994, will be based on Convention tonnage measurements.
    The applicability of tonnage-based laws in effect before July 19,
    1994, which are listed by the Secretary, will also be based on
    Convention tonnage. Therefore, the laws that will be based on
    regulatory tonnage are those not listed by the Secretary by
    regulation and those listed in section 14305 of this legislation.

      Revised section 14305
      Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.
      Section 14305 requires that the Secretary measure a vessel under
    chapter 145 (Regulatory Measurement) of this title (in addition to
    measuring it under the Convention) at the request of the owner. For
    vessels that have obtained a regulatory tonnage measurement under
    this section, the Secretary is required to use the regulatory
    tonnage measurement to determine the application of those laws
    listed in section 14305(a) and those not listed by the Secretary by
    regulation, as provided in section 14302(c). It is the intent of
    the Committee to list in section 14305(a) certain U.S. tonnage-
    based laws that would impose increased regulatory burdens on
    industry if the Convention measurement were used for applicability
    determinations.
      Clause (1) of section 14305(a) includes the following parts of
    subtitle II of title 46, U.S.C.:
        Part A: General provisions (including definitions.)
        Part B: Inspection and Regulation of Vessels.
        Part C: Load Lines, which is enacted as part of this
      legislation. Although most load line requirements are based on
      vessel length, and not tonnage, a few requirements are based on
      tonnage. (It is only the tonnage based requirements to which this
      provision applies.)
        Part E: Licenses, Certificates, and Merchant Mariners'
      Documents.
        Part F: Manning of Vessels.
        Part G: Merchant Seamen Protection and Relief.
        Part H: Sections 12106(c) and 12108(c) only - Identification of
      Vessels.
      The other U.S. laws listed in clause (2) through (10) of this
    section are self-explanatory. Clause (10) refers to domestic law as
    well as the Officers' Competency Certificates Convention, 1936.
      In addition, three other international conventions are listed in
    clauses (11) through (13): (1) the Convention for the Safety of
    Life at Sea, (2) the Convention on the Standards of Training,
    Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and (3) the
    Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The
    International Maritime Organization has established interim schemes
    which address the use of the Convention tonnage measurement system
    as a basis for the applicability of these three conventions. The
    applicable sections of those schemes are the following:
      The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea: IMCO
    Resolution A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981 provides "that at the
    request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship
    required to be measured under the provisions of the International
    Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross
    tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which are in
    effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage
    Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of the
    International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, such
    tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage
    Certificate." The resolution further provides that "the interim
    scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after
    31 December 1985 with the following exceptions:
        "(a) In respect of the requirements of Regulation 3 of Chapter
      IV of the 1974 SOLAS Convention for ships the keels of which are
      laid before 18 July 1994, the Administration may continue to
      apply the interim scheme, in which case the above-mentioned entry
      should be made in the Radio-telephony Certificate only; and
        "(b) In respect of the regulations for cargo ships of less than
      1,600 tons gross tonnage (as measured under national systems),
      the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the
      Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18
      July 1984."
      The International Convention on Standards of Training,
    Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978: IMO Resolution
    A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, provides "that the revised
    interim scheme for tonnage measurement for certain ships adopted by
    resolution A.494 (XII), [described above] should also be applicable
    in respect of the provision of the International Convention, and
    Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978."
      The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
    Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the
    International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
    Ships, 1973: IMO Resolution A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983,
    provides that:
        At the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a
      ship of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (measured under the
      previous national tonnage rules) the keel of which is laid on or
      before 31 December 1985 and which is required to be measured
      under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage
      Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured
      under the national tonnage rules which were in effect prior to
      the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the
      purpose of application of the provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Such
      tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage
      Certificate.
      It further provides that "the interim scheme shall not apply to
    ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, except
    that in respect of regulations for ships of less than 400 tons
    gross tonnage (as measured under previous national rules), the
    keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration
    may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1994."
      Clause (14) provides that the regulatory measurement system may
    be used to determine which vessels must demonstrate evidence of
    financial responsibility (when such a demonstration is required by
    law). If it is determined that a vessel must show evidence of
    financial responsibility, the limits of financial responsibility
    are determined using the vessel's Convention measurement.
      Clause (15) provides that the regulatory measurement system may
    be used for the application of laws not identified by the Secretary
    under section 14302(c).
      Section 14305(b) provides that if a vessel is measured under the
    regulatory tonnage measurement system for the application of one
    law listed in subsection (a), it must be measured under that system
    for the application of all laws listed in subsection (a).

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary may inspect a vessel of a foreign country to
    verify that - 
        (1) the vessel has an International Tonnage Certificate (1969)
      and the main characteristics of the vessel correspond to the
      information in the certificate; or
        (2) if the vessel is from a country not a party to the

      regulations similar to those of this chapter and the regulations
      prescribed under this chapter.

      (b) For a vessel of a country that is a party to the Convention,
    if the inspection reveals that the vessel does not have an
    International Tonnage Certificate (1969) or that the main
    characteristics of the vessel differ from those stated on the
    certificate or other records in a way that increases the gross or
    net tonnage of the vessel, the Secretary promptly shall inform the
    country whose flag the vessel is flying.
      (c) For a vessel of a country not a party to the Convention - 
        (1) if the vessel has been measured under laws and regulations
      that the Secretary finds are similar to those of this chapter and
      the regulations prescribed under this chapter, the vessel shall
      be deemed to have been issued an International Tonnage
      Certificate (1969); and
        (2) if the vessel has not been measured as described in clause
      (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may measure the vessel.

      (d) An inspection under this section shall be conducted in a way

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for measuring the
    gross and net tonnages of a vessel under this subchapter. The
    regulations shall provide for tonnages comparable to the tonnages
    that could have been assigned under sections 4151 and 4153 of the

    existed immediately before the enactment of this section.
      (b) On application of the owner or master of a vessel of the
    United States used in foreign trade, the Secretary may attach an
    appendix to the vessel's register stating the measurement of spaces
    that may be deducted from gross tonnage under laws and regulations
    of other countries but not under those of the United States.

      (a) On application by the owner and approval by the Secretary,
    the tonnage of spaces prescribed by the Secretary may be excluded
    in measuring under this section the gross tonnage of a vessel
    measured under section 14512 of this title. The spaces prescribed
    by the Secretary shall be comparable to the spaces that could have
    been excluded under section 2 of the Act of September 29, 1965
    (Public Law 89-219, 79 Stat. 891), as section 2 existed immediately
    before the enactment of this section.
      (b) The Secretary shall prescribe the design, location, and
    dimensions of the tonnage mark to be placed on a vessel measured
    under this section.
      (c)(1) If a vessel is assigned two sets of gross and net tonnages
    under this section, each certificate stating the vessel's tonnages
    shall state the gross and net tonnages when the vessel's tonnage
    mark is submerged and when it is not submerged.
      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a
    certificate stating a vessel's tonnages may state only one set of
    gross and net tonnages as assigned under this section.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In this section, "length" means the horizontal distance of
    the hull between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost
    part of the stern, excluding fittings and attachments.
      (b)(1) The Secretary shall assign gross and net tonnages to a
    vessel based on its length, breadth, depth, other dimensions, and
    appropriate coefficients.
      (2) The Secretary shall prescribe the way dimensions (except
    length) are measured and which coefficients are appropriate.
      (c) The resulting gross tonnages, taken as a group, reasonably
    shall reflect the relative internal volumes of the vessels measured
    under this subchapter. The resulting net tonnages shall be in
    approximately the same ratios to corresponding gross tonnages as
    are the net and gross tonnages of comparable vessels measured under
    subchapter II of this chapter.
      (d) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary
    may determine the gross and net tonnages of a vessel representative
    of a designated class, model, or type, and then assign those gross
    and net tonnages to other vessels of the same class, model, or
    type.

      In subsection (a), the words "law of a State" are substituted for
    "any State statute" for consistency in the revised title. The words
    "regulating the right to recover for death" are substituted for
    "giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death" to
    eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (b), the words "or to any navigable waters in the

    meaning of the provisions of title 48 of the Revised Statutes
    relating to the limitation of the liability of the owners of

    are not liable as carriers. The owner and master are not liable
    beyond the value entered on the bill of lading.
      (b) Items. - The items referred to in subsection (a) are precious
    metals, gold or silver plated articles, precious stones, jewelry,

    title, the liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim, debt,
    or liability described in subsection (b) shall not exceed the value
    of the vessel and pending freight. If the vessel has more than one

    and pending freight.
      (b) Claims Subject to Limitation. - Unless otherwise excluded by
    law, claims, debts, and liabilities subject to limitation under
    subsection (a) are those arising from any embezzlement, loss, or
    destruction of any property, goods, or merchandise shipped or put
    on board the vessel, any loss, damage, or injury by collision, or

      In subsection (a), the words "Except as provided in section 30506

    183(b) is restated in section 30506 of the revised title. The words
    "whether American or foreign" are omitted as unnecessary because of
    section 30502 of the revised title. The words "shall not exceed the
    value of the vessel and pending freight" are substituted for "shall
    not . . . exceed the amount or value of . . . such vessel, and her
    freight then pending" in 46 App. U.S.C. 183(a) and for "the
    aggregate liabilities of all the owners of a vessel on account of
    the same shall not exceed the value of such vessels and freight

    individual liability of a shipowner shall be limited to the
    proportion of any or all debts and liabilities that his individual
    share of the vessel bears to the whole" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 for
    clarity and consistency. The words "Provided, That this provision
    shall not prevent any claimant from joining all the owners in one
    action" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 are omitted as unnecessary.
      Subsection (c) is substituted for "nor shall the same apply to
    wages due to persons employed by said shipowners" in 46 App. U.S.C.
    189 because of the reorganization of the source provisions.

    Sec. 30506. Limit of liability for personal injury or death

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application. - This section applies only to seagoing vessels,
    but does not apply to pleasure yachts, tugs, towboats, towing
    vessels, tank vessels, fishing vessels, fish tender vessels, canal
    boats, scows, car floats, barges, lighters, or nondescript vessels.
      (b) Minimum Liability. - If the amount of the vessel owner's
    liability determined under section 30505 of this title is
    insufficient to pay all losses in full, and the portion available
    to pay claims for personal injury or death is less than $420 times
    the tonnage of the vessel, that portion shall be increased to $420
    times the tonnage of the vessel. That portion may be used only to
    pay claims for personal injury or death.
      (c) Calculation of Tonnage. - Under subsection (b), the tonnage
    of a self-propelled vessel is the gross tonnage without deduction
    for engine room, and the tonnage of a sailing vessel is the tonnage
    for documentation. However, space for the use of seamen is
    excluded.
      (d) Claims Arising on Distinct Occasions. - Separate limits of
    liability apply to claims for personal injury or death arising on
    distinct occasions.
      (e) Privity or Knowledge. - In a claim for personal injury or
    death, the privity or knowledge of the master or the owner's
    superintendent or managing agent, at or before the beginning of
    each voyage, is imputed to the owner.

      Subsection (a) is written as an application provision rather than
    as a definition to be more direct and to avoid having to repeat the
    word "seagoing" throughout the section. The words "fishing vessel,
    fish tender vessel" are substituted for "fishing vessels or their
    tenders" for clarity. The words "nondescript vessel" are
    substituted for "nondescript self-propelled vessels" and
    "nondescript non-self-propelled vessels" to eliminate unnecessary
    words. The words "self-propelled lighters" are omitted as covered
    by "lighter". The words "even though the same may be seagoing
    vessels within the meaning of such term as used in section 188 of
    this Appendix, as amended" are omitted as unnecessary. This
    provision is restated also at section 30508(a) of the revised
    title.
      In subsection (b), the words "is such that the portion available
    to pay claims for personal injury or death" are substituted for "is
    insufficient to pay all losses in full, and the portion of such
    amount applicable to the payment of losses in respect of loss of
    life or bodily injury" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (c), the words "self-propelled vessel" are
    substituted for "steam or motor vessel", and the words "tonnage for
    documentation" are substituted for "registered tonnage", for
    consistency in the revised title. The words "space for the use of
    seamen" are substituted for "space occupied by seamen or
    apprentices and appropriated to their use" to eliminate unnecessary
    words.
      In subsection (d), the words "Separate limits of liability apply"
    are substituted for "The owner . . . shall be liable . . . to the
    same extent as if no other loss of life or bodily injury had
    arisen" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (e), the words "the privity or knowledge . . . is
    imputed to the owner" are substituted for "shall be deemed
    conclusively the privity or knowledge of the owner" for consistency
    and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Sec. 30508. Provisions requiring notice of claim or limiting time
      for bringing action

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application. - This section applies only to seagoing vessels,
    but does not apply to pleasure yachts, tugs, towboats, towing
    vessels, tank vessels, fishing vessels, fish tender vessels, canal
    boats, scows, car floats, barges, lighters, or nondescript vessels.
      (b) Minimum Time Limits. - The owner, master, manager, or agent
    of a vessel transporting passengers or property between ports in
    the United States, or between a port in the United States and a
    port in a foreign country, may not limit by regulation, contract,
    or otherwise the period for - 
        (1) giving notice of, or filing a claim for, personal injury or
      death to less than 6 months after the date of the injury or
      death; or
        (2) bringing a civil action for personal injury or death to
      less than one year after the date of the injury or death.

      (c) Effect of Failure To Give Notice. - When notice of a claim
    for personal injury or death is required by a contract, the failure
    to give the notice is not a bar to recovery if - 
        (1) the court finds that the owner, master, or agent of the
      vessel had knowledge of the injury or death and the owner has not
      been prejudiced by the failure;
        (2) the court finds there was a satisfactory reason why the
      notice could not have been given; or
        (3) the owner of the vessel fails to object to the failure to
      give the notice.

      (d) Tolling of Period To Give Notice. - If a claimant is a minor
    or mental incompetent, or if a claim is for wrongful death, any
    period provided by a contract for giving notice of the claim is
    tolled until the earlier of - 
        (1) the date a legal representative is appointed for the minor,
      incompetent, or decedent's estate; or
        (2) 3 years after the injury or death.

      For an explanation of subsection (a), see the revision notes for
    section 30506(a), where 46 App. U.S.C. 183(f) is also restated.
      In subsection (b), before paragraph (1), the words "sea-going
    vessel (other than tugs, barges, fishing vessels and their
    tenders)" are omitted because of subsection (a) of this section.
    The word "merchandise" is omitted as covered by "property". The
    words "between ports in the United States, or between a port in the
    United States and a port in a foreign country" are substituted for
    "from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports" for
    clarity and for consistency with section 30509(a)(1) of the revised
    title. See Burstein v. United States Lines Co., 43 F. Supp. 226
    (S.D.N.Y. 1942), rev'd on other grounds, 134 F.2d 89 (2d Cir.
    1943). The word "rule" is omitted as covered by "regulation". In
    paragraph (1), the words "after the date of the injury or death"
    are added for clarity and consistency with paragraph (2).
      In subsection (c), before paragraph (1), the words "When notice
    of a claim for personal injury or death is required by a contract,
    the failure to give the notice" are substituted for "Failure to
    give such notice, where lawfully prescribed in such contract" for
    clarity. In paragraph (1), the words "the court finds" are stated
    at the beginning rather than the middle to be more precise. The
    word "damage" is omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (2), the
    words "the court finds there was a satisfactory reason" are
    substituted for "the court excuses such failure on the ground that
    for some satisfactory reason" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d), before paragraph (1), the word "claimant" is
    substituted for "person who is entitled to recover on any such
    claim" to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "lawful" is omitted
    as unnecessary. The words "is tolled until" are substituted for
    "shall not be applicable so long as" and "but shall be applicable
    from" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Injury. - 
        (1) In general. - Subsection (a) does not prohibit a provision
      in a contract or in ticket conditions of carriage with a
      passenger that relieves an owner, master, manager, agent,
      operator, or crewmember of a vessel from liability for infliction
      of emotional distress, mental suffering, or psychological injury
      so long as the provision does not limit such liability when the
      emotional distress, mental suffering, or psychological injury is -
       
          (A) the result of physical injury to the claimant caused by
        the negligence or fault of a crewmember or the owner, master,
        manager, agent, or operator;
          (B) the result of the claimant having been at actual risk of

      In subsection (a), the words "bring a civil action . . . in a
    district court of the United States" are substituted for "petition
    a district court of the United States" for consistency in the
    revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. See
    rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.).
    The words "of competent jurisdiction" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (b), the word "pending" before "freight" is added
    for consistency in the chapter. The words "to carry out this
    chapter" are substituted for "to carry out the provisions of
    section 183 of this Appendix" because of the reorganization of the
    source provisions.

      This chapter codifies the Act of February 13, 1893 (ch. 105, 27
    Stat. 445) (commonly known as the Harter Act). Changes are made to
    simplify, clarify, and modernize the language and style, but the
    intent is that these changes should not result in changes in
    substance.
      A definition of "carrier" is added based on language appearing in
    various provisions of the Harter Act. The definition avoids the
    need to repeat in various sections of this chapter the list of
    persons to whom the requirements and restrictions of this chapter
    apply, and it ensures that the list of persons is consistent in the
    chapter.

                       CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA ACT                   
      Act Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 229, 49 Stat. 1207, as amended by Pub. L.
    97-31, Sec. 12(146), Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 166, provided:
      "That every bill of lading or similar document of title which is
    evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from
    ports of the United States, in foreign trade, shall have effect
    subject to the provisions of this Act.
                                 "TITLE I                             
      "Section 1. When used in this Act - 
      "(a) The term 'carrier' includes the owner or the charterer who
    enters into a contract of carriage with a shipper.
      "(b) The term 'contract of carriage' applies only to contracts of
    carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of
    title, insofar as such document relates to the carriage of goods by
    sea, including any bill of lading or any similar document as
    aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charter party from the
    moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title
    regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same.
      "(c) The term 'goods' includes goods, wares, merchandise, and
    articles of every kind whatsoever, except live animals and cargo
    which by the contract of carriage is stated as being carried on
    deck and is so carried.
      "(d) The term 'ship' means any vessel used for the carriage of
    goods by sea.
      "(e) The term 'carriage of goods' covers the period from the time
    when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged
    from the ship.

                                  "RISKS                              
      "Sec. 2. Subject to the provisions of section 6, under every
    contract of carriage of goods by sea, the carrier in relation to
    the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and
    discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities
    and liabilities and entitled to the rights and immunities
    hereinafter set forth.

                     "RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES                 
      "Sec. 3. (1) The carrier shall be bound, before and at the
    beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to - 
      "(a) Make the ship seaworthy;
      "(b) Properly man, equip, and supply the ship;
      "(c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cooling chambers, and all
    other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe
    for their reception, carriage, and preservation.
      "(2) The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow,
    carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.
      "(3) After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier, or
    the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the
    shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other
    things - 
      "(a) The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods
    as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the
    loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or
    otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the
    cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a
    manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the
    voyage.
      "(b) Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity or
    weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.
      "(c) The apparent order and condition of the goods: Provided,
    That no carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, shall be bound to
    state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or
    weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately
    to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no
    reasonable means of checking.
      "(4) Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the
    receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in
    accordance with paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c), of this section:
    Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be construed as repealing
    or limiting the application of any part of the Act, as amended,
    entitled 'An Act relating to bills of lading in interstate and
    foreign commerce', approved August 29, 1916 (U.S.C., title 49,
    secs. 81-124), commonly known as the 'Pomerene Bills of Lading Act'
    [now chapter 801 of Title 49, Transportation].
      "(5) The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the
    carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number,
    quantity, and weight, as furnished by him; and the shipper shall
    indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages, and expenses
    arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The
    right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his
    responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any
    person other than the shipper.
      "(6) Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of
    such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent
    at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of
    the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery
    thereof under the contract of carriage, such removal shall be prima
    facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as
    described in the bill of lading. If the loss or damage is not
    apparent, the notice must be given within three days of the
    delivery.
      "Said notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt
    for the goods given by the person taking delivery thereof.
      "The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the
    goods has at the time of their receipt been the subject of joint
    survey or inspection.
      "In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from
    all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought
    within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the
    goods should have been delivered: Provided, That if a notice of
    loss or damage, either apparent or concealed, is not given as
    provided for in this section, that fact shall not affect or
    prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year
    after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should
    have been delivered.
      "In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the
    carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to
    each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.
      "(7) After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued
    by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier to the shipper
    shall, if the shipper so demands, be a 'shipped' bill of lading:
    Provided, That if the shipper shall have previously taken up any
    document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as
    against the issue of the 'shipped' bill of lading, but at the
    option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the
    port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or
    names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped
    and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted the same shall
    for the purpose of this section be deemed to constitute a 'shipped'
    bill of lading.
      "(8) Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage
    relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage
    to or in connection with the goods, arising from negligence, fault,
    or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section,
    or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this Act,
    shall be null and void and of no effect. A benefit of insurance in
    favor of the carrier, or similar clause, shall be deemed to be a
    clause relieving the carrier from liability.

                          "RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES                      
      "Sec. 4. (1) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for
    loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless
    caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make
    the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned,
    equipped, and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and
    cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are
    carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and
    preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of
    section 3. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from
    unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due
    diligence shall be on the carrier or other persons claiming
    exemption under this section.
      "(2) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for
    loss or damage arising or resulting from - 
      "(a) Act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or
    the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management
    of the ship;
      "(b) Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the
    carrier;
      "(c) Perils, dangers, and accidents of the sea or other navigable
    waters;
      "(d) Act of God;
      "(e) Act of war;
      "(f) Act of public enemies;
      "(g) Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers, or people, or
    seizure under legal process;
      "(h) Quarantine restrictions;
      "(i) Act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his
    agent or representative;
      "(j) Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from
    whatever cause, whether partial or general: Provided, That nothing
    herein contained shall be construed to relieve a carrier from
    responsibility for the carrier's own acts;
      "(k) Riots and civil commotions;
      "(l) Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea;
      "(m) Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage
    arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods;
      "(n) Insufficiency of packing;
      "(o) Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks;
      "(p) Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence; and
      "(q) Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity
    of the carrier and without the fault or neglect of the agents or
    servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the
    person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither
    the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect
    of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or
    damage.
      "(3) The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage
    sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any
    cause without the act, fault, or neglect of the shipper, his
    agents, or his servants.
      "(4) Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or
    property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to
    be an infringement or breach of this Act or of the contract of
    carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or
    damage resulting therefrom: Provided, however, That if the
    deviation is for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or
    passengers it shall, prima facie, be regarded as unreasonable.
      "(5) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or
    become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the
    transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package
    lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped
    in packages, per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that
    sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods
    have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in
    the bill of lading. This declaration, if embodied in the bill of
    lading, shall be prima facie evidence, but shall not be conclusive
    on the carrier.
      "By agreement between the carrier, master, or agent of the
    carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned
    in this paragraph may be fixed: Provided, That such maximum shall
    not be less than the figure above named. In no event shall the
    carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually
    sustained.
      "Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any
    event for loss or damage to or in connection with the
    transportation of the goods if the nature or value thereof has been
    knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of
    lading.
      "(6) Goods of an inflammable, explosive, or dangerous nature to
    the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier,
    has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may
    at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or
    rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the
    shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses
    directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such
    shipment. If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent
    shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner
    be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the
    carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to
    general average, if any.

            "SURRENDER OF RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES AND INCREASE OF
                     RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES
      "Sec. 5. A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or
    in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any
    of his responsibilities and liabilities under this Act, provided
    such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading
    issued to the shipper.
      "The provisions of this Act shall not be applicable to charter
    parties; but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship
    under a charter party, they shall comply with the terms of this
    Act. Nothing in this Act shall be held to prevent the insertion in
    a bill of lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.

                            "SPECIAL CONDITIONS                        
      "Sec. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding
    sections, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier, and a shipper
    shall, in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter
    into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and
    liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and
    immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his
    obligation as to seaworthiness (so far as the stipulation regarding
    seaworthiness is not contrary to public policy), or the care or
    diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading,
    handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and discharge of the
    goods carried by sea: Provided, That in this case no bill of lading
    has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be
    embodied in a receipt which shall be a nonnegotiable document and
    shall be marked as such.
      "Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect:
    Provided, That this section shall not apply to ordinary commercial
    shipments made in the ordinary course of trade but only to other
    shipments where the character or condition of the property to be
    carried or the circumstances, terms, and conditions under which the
    carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a

      (a) In General. - In a case in which, if a vessel were privately
    owned or operated, or if cargo were privately owned or possessed,
    or if a private person or property were involved, a civil action in
    admiralty could be maintained, a civil action in admiralty in
    personam may be brought against the United States or a federally-
    owned corporation. In a civil action in admiralty brought by the
    United States or a federally-owned corporation, an admiralty claim
    in personam may be filed or a setoff claimed against the United
    States or corporation.
      (b) Non-Jury. - A claim against the United States or a federally-
    owned corporation under this section shall be tried without a
    jury.

      In subsection (a), the words "civil action" are substituted for

    chapter. The words "civil action in admiralty in personam" are
    substituted for "any appropriate nonjury proceeding in personam"
    for clarity. The words "in rem or in personam in any district" are
    omitted as unnecessary. The words "admiralty claim" are substituted
    for "cross libel" for consistency in this chapter and with the
    various means of asserting a claim (such as by counterclaim or
    cross-claim) allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The
    words "with the same force and effect as if the libel had been
    filed by a private party" are omitted as unnecessary.
      Subsection (b) is substituted for the word "nonjury" to clarify
    that the nonjury requirement applies to any claim against the
    United States or a federally-owned corporation under this section

                       HISTORICAL AND REVISION NOTES                   
      Section 101 [102] of H.R. 3105 [became Pub. L. 100-710] revises,
    consolidates, and enacts certain general and permanent laws of the
    United States related to commercial instruments and liens and
    public vessels and goods. It amends subtitle III of title 46,
    United States Code by striking at the end "Chapters 313, 315 -
    Reserved" and substituting "Chapter 313 - Commercial Instruments
    and Maritime Liens". Chapter 313 is essentially a codification of
    the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 911-984). H.R. 3105 is
    the second step in the process of enacting laws compiled in title
    46 of the Code into positive law. The first step in the
    codification process began in 1983 when certain general and
    permanent laws related to vessels and seamen were enacted as
    subtitle II of the title 46, United States Code.

                           HOUSE FLOOR STATEMENT                       
      Section 102 of this bill adds a new subtitle III to title 46,
    which contains a codification of the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920 and
    other related provisions. A previous version of this codification
    and the remaining sections of the bill were recently reported by
    the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in H.R. 3105 (H. Rept.
    100-918). The significant additions or changes by this provision to

      Section 31301(1) defines the term "acknowledge". This paragraph
    makes a substantive change to law to expand the current law by
    allowing a notarization under State law, a form prescribed by the
    Secretary, as well as a certificate issued under the Hague
    Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign
    Public Documents, 1961.
      Section 31301(2) defines "district court". This paragraph makes a
    substantive change to law by including the District Court of Guam,
    the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the District Court of the
    Northern Mariana Islands, the High Court of American Samoa, and
    other Federal territorial courts as they are established. Under
    current law, only the district courts of the United States have
    jurisdiction under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.
      Section 31301(3) defines "mortgagee" as a person to whom property
    is mortgaged and the trustee authorized under section 31328 that is
    designated in the trust agreement.
      Section 31301(4) defines "necessaries" to include repairs,
    supplies, towage, and the use of a drydock and marine railway for a
    vessel. As in all codifications, the term "includes" means
    "includes but is not limited to" and, therefore, is not intended to
    be an exclusive listing of those items that a court has determined
    or may determine as falling within the meaning of the term "other
    necessaries" as contained in current law. The definition is new, is
    based on 46 App. U.S.C. 971-974, and makes no substantive change to
    law.
      Section 31301(5) defines "preferred maritime lien" to mean a lien
    on a vessel that arises before a preferred mortgage was filed under
    section 31321 of this title for damages arising out of maritime
    tort, stevedore wages, crew wages, general average, and salvage.
    The definition is new and is based on 46 App. U.S.C. 953(a). The
    only substantive change to law made by this paragraph is to change
    the effective date from the day the preferred mortgage is recorded
    and endorsed to when it is filed. This change is in keeping with
    other changes with regard to filing. The term "duly and validly"
    that is in existing law is not used because it is unnecessary. An
    instrument that is not "duly and validly" executed is not executed
    under the laws of the foreign country. This makes no substantive
    change to law.
      Section 31301(6)(A) defines "preferred mortgage" to mean a
    mortgage that meets the requirements of section 31322. This clause
    makes no substantive change to law.
      Section 31301(6)(B) defines "preferred mortgage" to also mean a
    mortgage on a documented foreign vessel that is preferred under
    sections 31325 and 31326 for purposes of enforcement of the
    outstanding mortgage indebtedness. Preference is only granted if
    the mortgage is executed under the laws of a foreign country,
    registered under those laws in a public register at the port of
    registry or at a central office. The use of the word "established"
    in place of "created" in the current law or "effective" as used in
    the treaties is not intended to make any substantive change to law.
    The only substantive changes to law made by this clause are the
    elimination of the exemption of foreign vessels of less than 200
    gross tons, and clarification of the rule of interpretation that if
    a vessel is registered in one country, but is permitted to fly
    temporarily the flag of another country (such as through a demise
    charter), it is the law of the country in which the ownership of
    the vessel is documented that is used to determine when a mortgage
    attains preferred status.

    4752, provided that:
      "(a) This title [see Tables for classification] and amendments
    made by this title take effect on January 1, 1989. However,
    sections 31321 and 31322 of title 46 (as enacted by section 102 of
    this Act), United States Code (as sections 31321 and 32322
    [probably should be 31322] apply to vessels for which an
    application for documentation has been filed), take effect on
    January 1, 1990.
      "(b) An instrument filed before January 1, 1989, but not recorded
    before that date, is deemed to comply with section 31321 of title
    46, United States Code, if it is in substantial compliance with the
    provisions in that section that had corresponding requirements
    under the law on December 31, 1988. However, the mortgage may not
    become a preferred mortgage until the vessel is documented.
      "(c) This title and the amendments made by this title do not
    affect the validity of any instrument filed or recorded before
    January 1, 1989, if there was a corresponding requirement under the
    law on December 31, 1988.
      "(d) An instrument filed or recorded before January 1, 1989, is
    deemed to comply with any new requirement under chapter 313 of
    title 46, United States Code (as enacted by section 102 of this
    Act), affecting the validity of that instrument.
      "(e) Section 102 of this Act and amendments made by that section
    [enacting former section 30101 and sections 31301 to 31309, 31321
    to 31330, and 31341 to 31343 of this title and provisions set out
    as a note preceding section 2101 of this title] do not affect any
    civil action filed before January 1, 1989.
      "(f) Section 104(b) of this Act and the amendments made by
    section 104(b) of this Act [amending section 808 of the former
    Appendix to this title] do not apply to any change in control
    resulting from, or which may at any time result from, any proposed
    plan of reorganization filed under the United States bankruptcy
    laws prior to the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 23, 1988],
    except that transactions undertaken as a result of such a plan
    shall continue to be governed by section 9 of the Shipping Act,
    1916 ([former] 46 App. U.S.C. 808) [see 46 U.S.C. 56101, 57109], as
    it existed prior to the date of enactment of this Act, to the
    extent that such section 9 would have governed such transactions."

      (a) If a person makes a contract secured by, or on the credit of,

    and sustains a monetary loss because the mortgagor or the master or
    other individual in charge of the vessel does not comply with a
    requirement imposed on the mortgagor, master, or individual under
    this chapter, the mortgagor is liable for the loss.
      (b) A civil action may be brought to recover for losses referred
    to in subsection (a) of this section. The district courts have
    original jurisdiction of the action, regardless of the amount in

      Section 31304 imposes liability on the mortgagor if the
    mortgagor, master, or other individual in charge of the vessel does
    not comply with the statutory requirements. A civil action may be
    brought in a district court of the United States for losses
    incurred. If the plaintiff prevails, the court shall award costs
    and attorneys fees to the plaintiff. This section makes two
    substantive changes to law. First, is the broadening of its
    coverage from documented vessels covered by a preferred mortgage to
    any vessel covered by a mortgage that is filed or recorded under
    the chapter. The second substantive change repeals the liability on
    the United States Government for losses caused because the
    Secretary did not comply with statutory requirements. This is
    covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act due to the nondiscretionary
    responsibility of the Secretary.

      Section 31305 provides for the waiver of lien rights by the
    mortgagee or a person performing or supplying necessaries. This
    section makes no substantive change to law and is included only
    because of a like provision in current law. Without this provision
    the Committee believes these waivers would be permissible as a
    matter of law as they do not violate any public policy and on their
    face reflect an arms length transaction between the parties. The
    inclusion of this provision should not raise the implication that a
    similar provision is required for other matters that may be
    waivable as a matter of law.

    documented vessel or a vessel for which an application for
    documentation is filed, must be filed with the Secretary to be

      (3) The parties to an instrument or an application for
    documentation shall use diligence to ensure that the parts of the
    instrument or application for which they are responsible are in
    substantial compliance with the filing and documentation
    requirements.
      (4) A bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related
    instrument may be filed electronically under regulations prescribed
    by the Secretary.
      (b) To be filed, a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage,
    assignment, or related instrument must - 
        (1) identify the vessel;
        (2) state the name and address of each party to the instrument;
        (3) state, if a mortgage, the amount of the direct or

      excluding interest, expenses, and fees;
        (4) state the interest of the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor
      in the vessel;
        (5) state the interest sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned;
      and
        (6) be signed and acknowledged.

      (c) If a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or
    related document is filed that involves a vessel for which an
    application for documentation is filed, and the Secretary decides
    that the vessel cannot be documented by an applicant - 
        (1) the Secretary shall send notice of the Secretary's
      decision, including reasons for the decision, to each interested
      party to the instrument filed for recording; and
        (2) 90 days after sending the notice as provided under clause

          (B) may return the instrument filed without recording it
        under subsection (e) of this section.

      (d) A person may withdraw an application for documentation of a
    vessel for which a mortgage has been filed under this section only
    if the mortgagee consents.
      (e) The Secretary shall - 
        (1) record the bills of sale, conveyances, mortgages,
      assignments, and related instruments of a documented vessel
      complying with subsection (b) of this section in the order they

      (g) The mortgage or related instrument of a vessel covered by a
    preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) of this title, that is

    documentation is filed, is valid under this section from the time
    the mortgage or instrument representing financing became a
    preferred mortgage under section 31322(d).
      (h) On full and final discharge of the indebtedness under a
    mortgage deemed to be a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d)

    or mortgagor, shall provide the Secretary or the State, as
    appropriate, with an acknowledged certificate of discharge of the

      Section 31321(a)(1) provides for the filing of a bill of sale,
    conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument of a
    vessel. This subsection makes substantive changes to law. The bill
    would allow a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or
    related instrument to be filed at the same time an application for
    documentation under chapter 121 is filed. The Committee intends
    that the types of related instruments required to be filed be
    defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
    Transportation. A major change the bill makes is that the
    instrument needs only be filed with the Secretary of Transportation
    to be valid. It is not necessary that it be recorded. This change
    is being made to eliminate a problem under existing law that
    prevents a person from recording an instrument when the vessel has
    not been yet documented. When filed with the Secretary, it is valid
    (to the extent the vessel is involved) against any person except
    the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor, their heirs or devisees, and a
    person having actual notice of that instrument. Clauses (A)-(C)
    make no substantive change to law.
      Paragraph (2) provides that each bill of sale, conveyance,
    mortgage, assignment, or related instrument that is filed in
    substantial compliance with the requirements of this section is
    valid against any person from the time it is filed with the
    Secretary.
      Paragraph (3) provides that it is the responsibility of the
    parties to an instrument to use diligence to ensure that the
    particulars of a filed instrument for which they are responsible
    are in substantial compliance. It is not the responsibility of the
    Secretary to validate the information in the instrument. If an
    instrument is later found to be invalid because it is not in
    substantial compliance, and the parties lose the benefits of a
    preferred mortgage, it is their fault, not the Secretary's.
      Section 31321(b) sets out the requirements that an instrument
    must meet to be properly filed. To be filed the instruments must:
    (1) identify the vessel; (2) state the name and address of each
    party to the instrument; (3) state, if a mortgage, the amount of
    the direct or contingent obligations (in one or more units of
    account as agreed to by the parties) that is or may become secured
    by the mortgage, excluding interest, expenses, and fees; (4) state
    the interest of the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor; (5) state the
    interest sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned; and (6) be signed
    and acknowledged. While most of these items are required under
    current law to be included in the index, and therefore required to
    be submitted to the Secretary to be recorded, this subsection makes
    a number of substantive changes to law. First, while vessel names
    are currently required to be submitted, this requirement has been
    broadened so that hull identification numbers and official numbers
    can be used to more specifically identify a vessel (since many
    vessels have the same name). Second, it requires the mortgage to
    state the maximum amount of the obligation, including principal,
    interest, fees, etc., that are secured by the mortgage. It also
    clarifies that the mortgage obligation may be payable in more than
    one unit of account, such as yen, franc, or special drawing right.
    Third, it recognizes that under some modern financing practices an
    instrument may not have a date of maturity. The requirement for
    supplying the date of maturity has been eliminated.
      Section 31321(c) provides that if an instrument filed involves a
    vessel that has not yet been documented, and the Secretary decides
    that the vessel cannot be documented by the applicant, then the
    Secretary shall send notice of that denial to the parties,
    including the reasons for the Secretary's decision. If the parties
    have not corrected the deficiencies within 90 days, the Secretary
    may terminate the filing and return the instruments. This
    invalidates the instruments.
      Section 31321(d) prohibits a person from withdrawing an
    application for documentation of a vessel for which a mortgage has
    been filed unless the mortgagee consents. Since the withdrawal will
    invalidate the mortgage, the mortgagee should be allowed to
    prohibit the withdrawal.
      Section 31321(e) makes a substantive change to law. It requires
    the Secretary to record instruments in the order they are received
    for filing, not in the order in which they were received for
    recording. It also makes a substantive change by eliminating the
    specific indexes required under the law and substituting a general
    requirement for the Secretary to maintain indexes of instruments
    filed or recorded, or both, for use by the public. These indexes,
    prescribed by regulations, must be in keeping with U.S. obligations
    under treaties to which the United States is a party. Since section
    104 [105] of this Act makes the existing rules and regulations
    applicable under this subsection, the current indexing system will
    be maintained that includes the names of the vessels; names of the
    parties to the instruments; time and date each instrument was
    received; the interest in the vessel that was sold, conveyed,
    mortgaged, or assigned; and the date of the maturity of the
    mortgage, if any. However, it allows the Secretary by regulation to
    automate the system with computers, as long as the new system
    provides the public with an adequate method of finding and
    examining these public records.
      Section 31321(f) makes a substantive change to law by eliminating
    the requirement that a partial discharge of indebtedness be filed
    with the Secretary. The bill requires that on the full and final
    discharge of indebtedness the mortgagee, on request of the
    Secretary or mortgagor, shall provide the Secretary with a written,
    acknowledged certificate of discharge of the indebtedness. This
    subsection also makes a substantive change by requiring that the
    mortgagee, not the mortgagor, provide the certificate of discharge.
    The Secretary shall then record the certificate. However, this does
    not prohibit a person from submitting a certificate of discharge
    under subsection (a) since it is a related instrument. This
    subsection also makes a substantive change to law by eliminating
    the requirement that the discharge be endorsed on the vessel's
    certificate of documentation, and that the Customs Service only may
    clear a vessel after an endorsement has been made. This change is
    made because of the elimination of endorsements under section
    31322.

                           HOUSE FLOOR STATEMENT                       
      Section 31321 has been changed to clarify that a mortgage,
    whenever made, must be filed to be valid against third parties.
    This clarification allows mortgage closings to occur previous to
    filing of an instrument, and to eliminate the need for a fictional
    simultaneous closing and filing.
      Subsection (g) clarifies that if an application for documentation
    is filed for a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage under section
    31322(d) (as enacted by this Act), the preferred mortgage must be
    filed with the Secretary at the same time the application for
    documentation is filed to be valid against third parties. If the
    preferred mortgage is filed with the Secretary at the time the
    documentation application is filed, it is valid from the time it
    became a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d).
      When a State preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) is finally
    discharged, subsection (h) of this section requires the mortgagee
    to provide upon request to the Secretary or a State, whichever is
    more appropriate, an acknowledged certificate of discharge of
    indebtedness. This is necessary when a vessel in the system moves
    from a participating titling State and is not retitled in another
    participating State. In this case, there is no way to update the
    status of the indebtedness through the original titling State. The
    Secretary is required to accept this information to be maintained
    in the vessel identification system under section 12503(c) of title
    46 (as enacted by this Act).

                                AMENDMENTS                            
      2010 - Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 111-281 struck out "of
    Transportation" after "Secretary" in introductory provisions.
      2002 - Subsec. (a)(4) Pub. L. 107-295 struck out subpar. (A)
    designation before "A bill of sale" and subpar. (B) which read as
    follows: "A filing made electronically under subparagraph (A) shall
    not be effective after the 10-day period beginning on the date of
    the filing unless the original instrument is provided to the
    Secretary within that 10-day period."
      1996 - Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 104-324 added par. (4).
      1989 - Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 101-225 substituted "for which an
    application for documentation is filed" for "that has not yet been
    documented" in introductory provisions and "interested party to"
    for "party whose name and address is stated on" in par. (1).

                              EFFECTIVE DATE

    filed before that date, and, insofar as applicable to vessels for
    which an application for documentation has been filed, effective
    Jan. 1, 1990, with further provision for an instrument filed before
    Jan. 1, 1989, but not recorded before that date, and with other
    qualifications, see section 107 of Pub. L. 100-710, set out as a

    Sec. 31322. Preferred mortgages

-STATUTE-
      (a) A preferred mortgage is a mortgage, whenever made, that - 
        (1) includes the whole of the vessel;
        (2) is filed in substantial compliance with section 31321 of
      this title;
        (3)(A) covers a documented vessel; or
        (B) covers a vessel for which an application for documentation
      is filed that is in substantial compliance with the requirements
      of chapter 121 of this title and the regulations prescribed under
      that chapter; and
        (4) with respect to a vessel with a fishery endorsement that is
      100 feet or greater in registered length, has as the mortgagee - 
          (A) a person eligible to own a vessel with a fishery
        endorsement under section 12113(c) of this title;
          (B) a state (!1) or federally chartered financial institution
        that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

          (C) a farm credit lender established under title 12, chapter
        23 of the United States Code;
          (D) a commercial fishing and agriculture bank established
        pursuant to State law;
          (E) a commercial lender organized under the laws of the
        United States or of a State and eligible to own a vessel for
        purposes of documentation under section 12103 of this title; or
          (F) a mortgage trustee under subsection (f) of this section.

      (b) Any indebtedness secured by a preferred mortgage that is
    filed or recorded under this chapter, or that is subject to a
    mortgage, security agreement, or instruments granting a security
    interest that is deemed to be a preferred mortgage under subsection
    (d) of this section, may have any rate of interest to which the
    parties agree.
      (c)(1) If a preferred mortgage includes more than one vessel or
    property that is not a vessel, the mortgage may provide for the
    separate discharge of each vessel and all property not a vessel by
    the payment of a part of the mortgage indebtedness.
      (2) If a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage that includes
    more than one vessel or property that is not a vessel is to be sold
    on the order of a district court in a civil action in rem, and the
    mortgage does not provide for separate discharge as provided under
    paragraph (1) of this subsection - 
        (A) the mortgage constitutes a lien on that vessel in the full
      amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness; and
        (B) an allocation of mortgage indebtedness for purposes of
      separate discharge may not be made among the vessel and other
      property covered by the mortgage.

      (d)(1) A mortgage, security agreement, or instrument granting a
    security interest perfected under State law covering the whole of a
    vessel titled in a State is deemed to be a preferred mortgage if - 
        (A) the Secretary certifies that the State titling system
      complies with the Secretary's guidelines for a titling system
      under section 13107(b)(8) of this title; and
        (B) information on the vessel covered by the mortgage, security
      agreement, or instrument is made available to the Secretary under
      chapter 125 of this title.

      (2) This subsection applies to mortgages, security agreements, or
    instruments covering vessels titled in a State after - 
        (A) the Secretary's certification under paragraph (1)(A) of
      this subsection; and
        (B) the State begins making information available to the
      Secretary under chapter 125 of this title.

      (3) A preferred mortgage under this subsection continues to be a
    preferred mortgage even if the vessel is no longer titled in the
    State where the mortgage, security agreement, or instrument
    granting a security interest became a preferred mortgage under this
    subsection.
      (e) If a vessel is already covered by a preferred mortgage when
    an application for titling or documentation is filed - 
        (1) the status of the preferred mortgage covering the vessel to
      be titled in the State is determined by the law of the
      jurisdiction where the vessel is currently titled or documented;
      and
        (2) the status of the preferred mortgage covering the vessel to
      be documented under chapter 121 is determined by subsection (a)
      of this section.

      (f)(1) A mortgage trustee may hold in trust, for an individual or
    entity, an instrument or evidence of indebtedness, secured by a
    mortgage of the vessel to the mortgage trustee, provided that the
    mortgage trustee - 
        (A) is eligible to be a preferred mortgagee under subsection
      (a)(4), subparagraphs (A)-(E) of this section;
        (B) is organized as a corporation, and is doing business, under
      the laws of the United States or of a State;
        (C) is authorized under those laws to exercise corporate trust
      powers;
        (D) is subject to supervision or examination by an official of
      the United States Government or a State;
        (E) has a combined capital and surplus (as stated in its most
      recent published report of condition) of at least $3,000,000; and
        (F) meets any other requirements prescribed by the Secretary.

      (2) If the beneficiary under the trust arrangement is not a
    commercial lender, a lender syndicate or eligible to be a preferred
    mortgagee under subsection (a)(4), subparagraphs (A)-(E) of this
    section, the Secretary must determine that the issuance,
    assignment, transfer, or trust arrangement does not result in an
    impermissible transfer of control of the vessel to a person not
    eligible to own a vessel with a fishery endorsement under section
    12113(c) of this title.
      (3) A vessel with a fishery endorsement may be operated by a
    mortgage trustee only with the approval of the Secretary.
      (4) A right under a mortgage of a vessel with a fishery
    endorsement may be issued, assigned, or transferred to a person not
    eligible to be a mortgagee of that vessel under this section only
    with the approval of the Secretary.
      (5) The issuance, assignment, or transfer of an instrument or
    evidence of indebtedness contrary to this subsection is voidable by
    the Secretary.
      (g) For purposes of this section a "commercial lender" means an
    entity primarily engaged in the business of lending and other
    financing transactions with a loan portfolio in excess of
    $100,000,000, of which not more than 50 per centum in dollar amount
    consists of loans to borrowers in the commercial fishing industry,
    as certified to the Secretary by such lender.
      (h) For purposes of this section a "lender syndicate" means an
    arrangement established for the combined extension of credit of not
    less than $20,000,000 made up of four or more entities that each
    have a beneficial interest, held through an agent, under a trust
    arrangement established pursuant to subsection (f), no one of which
    may exercise powers thereunder without the concurrence of at least
    one other unaffiliated beneficiary.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 31322 sets out the conditions that must be met for a
    mortgage to be considered a preferred mortgage, and the types of
    endorsements that the Secretary must make on any certificate of
    documentation of a vessel that is to be covered by a preferred
    mortgage.
      Subsection (a)(1) makes many substantive changes to law. While a
    preferred mortgage must still include the whole of a vessel, this
    subsection eliminates the exception of certain vessels under 25
    gross tons. It allows a vessel for which an application for
    documentation has been filed to have a preferred mortgage. It
    allows a mortgage to be a preferred mortgage from the time all four
    conditions are met, rather than from when the vessel is finally
    documented. Therefore, a mortgage will usually attain its preferred
    status when the application for documentation and the instrument
    have been filed. This subsection changes the requirement that all
    documented vessels have as a mortgagee a person that is a citizen
    of the United States, as defined in section 2 of the Shipping Act,
    1916, and allows a State, the United States Government, a federally
    insured depository institution, or any other person approved by the
    Secretary to be a mortgagee.
      Subsection (a)(2) makes a substantive change to law exempting
    fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels, and vessels
    operated only for pleasure from the mortgagee restrictions, since
    these vessels do not have significant national defense use.
      Subsection (b) permits a preferred mortgage to have any rate of
    interest that is agreeable to the parties to the mortgage. This
    subsection makes no substantive change to law.
      Subsection (c)(1) applies to a mortgage that covers more than one
    vessel or additional property that is not a vessel. This subsection
    allows a preferred mortgage to include a separate discharge of the
    additional vessels and property.
      Subsection (c)(2) applies when a preferred mortgage covers more
    than one vessel, does not provide for the separate discharge of a
    vessel, and is to be sold by court order. The amount of the
    mortgage indebtedness attributable to a vessel is that part of the
    indebtedness, increased by 20 percent, that the court determines
    approximates the value that the particular vessel bears to the
    value of all the vessels and property covered by the mortgage. In
    other words, the amount to be set by the court is the estimated
    value of the one vessel plus 20 percent of that value to assure
    sufficiency of collateral.
      This section also makes a substantive change by eliminating the
    requirement that a vessel's certificate of documentation be
    endorsed with information from the mortgage. This change is made
    since most of the information is out of date when examined, and
    since a mortgage must be carried on self-propelled vessels under
    section 31324(b). This section also eliminates the requirement for
    the inclusion of an affidavit of good faith. However, both criminal
    and civil penalties have been added [in section 31330] to help
    ensure that there is not fraud. This section also eliminates the
    requirement that a preferred mortgage include a separate discharge
    for additional property that is not a vessel, the requirement that
    the mortgage does not stipulate that the mortgagee waives the
    mortgage's preferred status; and the requirement for clearing
    vessels with endorsed documents through Customs.

                           HOUSE FLOOR STATEMENT                       
      Under section 31322(a)(2) a "vessel operated only for pleasure"
    is exempt from any restrictions on who can be a mortgagee. This
    standard is the same as used for the documentation of a
    recreational vessel under section 12109 of title 46. The Committee
    intends that vessels that have a recreational vessel license, or
    combined fisheries and recreational license, fall under this
    exemption. However, if the vessel has a Coastwise License, Great
    Lakes License, or Registry combined with a Recreational License,
    the vessel would not fall under this exemption.
      Under subsection (c)(2), if a vessel covered by a preferred
    mortgage that includes more than one vessel or property that is not
    a vessel is to be sold on the order of a district court in rem, and
    there is not a separate discharge, then the mortgage constitutes a
    lien on that vessel in the full amount of the outstanding mortgage
    indebtedness, and an allocation of mortgage indebtedness for
    purposes of a separate discharge may not be made. This change is
    made to eliminate the formula that did not work and to allow the
    vessel to be sold free and clear, regardless of the amount of the
    sale.
      Under subsection (d) of section 31322, a mortgage or other
    instrument representing financing of a vessel under State law that
    is made under applicable State law and covers the whole of a vessel
    titled in a State is deemed to be a preferred mortgage if two
    conditions are fulfilled. The first condition is that the Secretary
    must certify that the State in which the vessel is titled has a
    titling system that complies with the Secretary's vessel titling
    guidelines established under section 13106(b)(8) of title 46.
    Congress mandated the promulgation of these guidelines in the
    Recreational Boating Safety Act of 1986, Public Law 99-626. The
    second condition is that the State in which the vessel is titled
    must make information available to the Secretary for the vessel
    identification system established under chapter 125 of title 46 (as
    enacted by this Act) on the vessel covered by the mortgage or other
    instrument. This status only applies to vessels titled in the State
    after those two conditions are met. The phrase "instrument
    representing financing of a vessel under State law" is used in
    addition to "mortgage" because State laws do not always use the
    term mortgage when referring to financing. It is intended, however,
    that the financing covered by this phrase would be the same as that
    covered by the concept of a mortgage under other Federal law.
      Paragraph (2) of subsection (d) clarifies that mortgages or other
    financing instruments may obtain preferred status under subsection
    (d) if they cover vessels titled in a State after the Secretary
    certifies the compliance of the State's titling system, and the
    State begins making vessel identification information available to
    the Secretary. Preferred mortgage status can only be attained when
    these two conditions are in effect. Mortgages or financing
    instruments made prior to that are not preferred and, if these two
    conditions cease to exist, new mortgages or forecasting instruments
    made after that time cannot attain preferred status.
      The law of the titling State controls the making of the preferred
    mortgage or financing instrument under this subsection. No
    additional Federal recording requirements may be imposed for the
    mortgage or instrument to obtain preferred status under this
    subsection.
      Paragraph (3) of this subsection ensures that a preferred
    mortgage under this subsection retains that status if the vessel
    covered by the mortgage later relinquishes its title. If the vessel
    is subsequently documented, the continuing validity of the mortgage
    is determined by section 31321(g) (as enacted by this Act).
      Subsection (e) of section 31322 clarifies the validity of
    preferred mortgages made under subsection (d). In the case of a
    State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which a new
    titling application is filed, the validity of the mortgage is
    governed by the law of the titling State in which the mortgage
    became preferred. In the case of a documented vessel covered by a
    preferred mortgage for which an application for a State title is
    filed, or a State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for
    which an application for documentation is filed, the validity of
    the preferred mortgage is governed by section 31322(a) of title 46
    (as enacted by this Act).
      Information on vessels with preferred mortgages made under State
    law will be available to creditors from the vessel identification
    system under chapter 125 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 31325. Preferred mortgage liens and enforcement

-STATUTE-
      (a) A preferred mortgage is a lien on the mortgaged vessel in the
    amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness secured by the
    vessel.
      (b) On default of any term of the preferred mortgage, the
    mortgagee may - 
        (1) enforce the preferred mortgage lien in a civil action in
      rem for a documented vessel, a vessel to be documented under
      chapter 121 of this title, a vessel titled in a State, or a
      foreign vessel;
        (2) enforce a claim for the outstanding indebtedness secured by
      the mortgaged vessel in - 
          (A) a civil action in personam in admiralty against the
        mortgagor, maker, comaker, or guarantor for the amount of the
        outstanding indebtedness or any deficiency in full payment of
        that indebtedness; and
          (B) a civil action against the mortgagor, maker, comaker, or
        guarantor for the amount of the outstanding indebtedness or any
        deficiency in full payment of that indebtedness; and

        (3) enforce the preferred mortgage lien or a claim for the
      outstanding indebtedness secured by the mortgaged vessel, or
      both, by exercising any other remedy (including an extrajudicial
      remedy) against a documented vessel, a vessel for which an
      application for documentation is filed under chapter 121 of this
      title, a vessel titled in a State, a foreign vessel, or a
      mortgagor, maker, comaker, or guarantor for the amount of the
      outstanding indebtedness or any deficiency in full payment of
      that indebtedness, if - 
          (A) the remedy is allowed under applicable law; and
          (B) the exercise of the remedy will not result in a violation
        of section 56101 or 56102 of this title.

      (c) The district courts have original jurisdiction of a civil
    action brought under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
    However, for a documented vessel, a vessel to be documented under
    chapter 121 of this title, a vessel titled in a State, or a foreign
    vessel, this jurisdiction is exclusive of the courts of the States
    for a civil action brought under subsection (b)(1) of this section.
      (d)(1) Actual notice of a civil action brought under subsection
    (b)(1) of this section, or to enforce a maritime lien, must be
    given in the manner directed by the court to - 
        (A) the master or individual in charge of the vessel;
        (B) any person that recorded under section 31343(a) or (d) of
      this title an unexpired notice of a claim of an undischarged lien
      on the vessel; and
        (C) a mortgagee of a mortgage filed or recorded under section
      31321 of this title that is an undischarged mortgage on the
      vessel.

      (2) Notice under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not required
    if, after search satisfactory to the court, the person entitled to
    the notice has not been found in the United States.
      (3) Failure to give notice required by this subsection does not
    affect the jurisdiction of the court in which the civil action is
    brought. However, unless notice is not required under paragraph (2)
    of this subsection, the party required to give notice is liable to
    the person not notified for damages in the amount of that person's
    interest in the vessel terminated by the action brought under
    subsection (b)(1) of this section. A civil action may be brought to
    recover the amount of the terminated interest. The district courts
    have original jurisdiction of the action, regardless of the amount
    in controversy or the citizenship of the parties. If the plaintiff
    prevails, the court may award costs and attorney fees to the
    plaintiff.
      (e) In a civil action brought under subsection (b)(1) of this
    section - 
        (1) the court may appoint a receiver and authorize the receiver
      to operate the mortgaged vessel and shall retain in rem
      jurisdiction over the vessel even if the receiver operates the
      vessel outside the district in which the court is located; and
        (2) when directed by the court, a United States marshal may
      take possession of a mortgaged vessel even if the vessel is in
      the possession or under the control of a person claiming a
      possessory common law lien.

      (f)(1) Before title to the documented vessel or vessel for which
    an application for documentation is filed under chapter 121 is
    transferred by an extrajudicial remedy, the person exercising the
    remedy shall give notice of the proposed transfer to the Secretary,
    to the mortgagee of any mortgage on the vessel filed in substantial
    compliance with section 31321 of this title before notice of the
    proposed transfer is given to the Secretary, and to any person that
    recorded an unexpired notice of a claim of an undischarged lien on
    the vessel under section 31343(a) or (d) of this title before
    notice of the proposed transfer is given to the Secretary.
      (2) Failure to give notice as required by this subsection shall
    not affect the transfer of title to a vessel. However, the rights
    of any holder of a maritime lien or a preferred mortgage on the
    vessel shall not be affected by a transfer of title by an
    extrajudicial remedy exercised under this section, regardless of
    whether notice is required by this subsection or given.
      (3) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations establishing the
    time and manner for providing notice under this subsection.

      Section 31325 provides for the enforcement of a preferred
    mortgage lien.
      Section 31325(a) makes a "preferred mortgage" a lien on the
    vessel in the amount of the mortgage indebtedness secured by the
    vessel outstanding at foreclosure. This subsection makes no
    substantive change to law.
      Section 31325(b) provides that, on default of any term, the
    mortgagee may enforce the preferred mortgage lien in a civil action
    in rem, or in personam in admiralty against the mortgagor, comaker,
    or guarantor for the amount of the outstanding indebtedness secured
    by the vessel or any deficiency in paying off that indebtedness.
    This subsection makes a substantive change to law by allowing a
    nonadmiralty civil action to be brought against the mortgagor,
    comaker, or guarantor for the amount of the outstanding
    indebtedness secured by the vessel or any deficiency in paying off
    that indebtedness. This change allows an action to be brought even
    when the vessel is outside U.S. jurisdiction. This section will
    also allow the action to be brought against the comaker or
    guarantor of the mortgage.
      Section 31325(c) provides for original and exclusive jurisdiction
    by a district court, to the exclusion of the courts of a State for
    civil actions brought in rem. It also provides for original
    jurisdiction for civil actions brought in personam in admiralty and
    civil actions brought under subsection (b)(3). This subsection
    makes a substantive change to law by broadening the jurisdiction to
    courts in the territories, as defined in section 31301, as well as
    giving original jurisdiction to the district courts in nonadmiralty
    civil actions brought to enforce the preferred mortgage lien.
      Subsection (d) provides that actual notice of a civil action in
    rem to enforce a maritime lien must be given in a manner directed
    by the court to the master, individual in charge of the vessel, to
    any person that recorded a notice of a claim of an undischarged
    lien, and, for the first time, to the mortgagee of a mortgage filed
    with the Secretary. This notice is not required if, after a search
    is made that is satisfactory to the court, the person entitled to
    notice is not found in the United States. Failure to give notice
    does not affect the court's jurisdiction. However, the mortgagor is
    still liable to the person not notified for damages in the amount
    of that person's interest in the vessel that was terminated by the
    civil action in rem, and a civil action may still be brought to
    recover the amount of the terminated interest. The district courts
    have original jurisdiction of the action, regardless of the amount
    in controversy or the citizenship of the parties. If plaintiff
    prevails, the court shall award costs and attorneys fees to the
    plaintiff.
      Subsection (e) provides that, in a civil action in rem, the court
    may appoint a receiver and authorize operation of the vessel. When
    directed by the court, a United States marshal may take possession -
     even if the vessel is in the possession of or under the control
    of a person claiming a possessory common law lien. This subsection
    makes a substantive change to law by allowing the court to retain
    in rem jurisdiction over the vessel even if the receiver operates
    the vessel outside the district in which the court is located.

                           HOUSE FLOOR STATEMENT                       
      Subsection (c) of this section clarifies that the district courts
    have original jurisdiction for a civil action under subsection (b)
    of this section, and exclusive jurisdiction in the case of vessels
    documented or to be documented under chapter 121 of title 46.

-STATUTE-
      (a) When a vessel is sold by order of a district court in a civil
    action in rem brought to enforce a preferred mortgage lien or a
    maritime lien, any claim in the vessel existing on the date of sale
    is terminated, including a possessory common law lien of which a

    vessel is sold free of all those claims.
      (b) Each of the claims terminated under subsection (a) of this
    section attaches, in the same amount and in accordance with their
    priorities to the proceeds of the sale, except that - 
        (1) the preferred mortgage lien, including a preferred mortgage
      lien on a foreign vessel whose mortgage has been guaranteed under
      chapter 537 of this title, has priority over all claims against
      the vessel (except for expenses and fees allowed by the court,
      costs imposed by the court, and preferred maritime liens); and
        (2) for a foreign vessel whose mortgage has not been guaranteed
      under chapter 537 of this title, the preferred mortgage lien is
      subordinate to a maritime lien for necessaries provided in the
      United States.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 31326(a) provides for a court-ordered sale to enforce a
    preferred mortgage lien or a maritime lien and the priority of
    claims. When a mortgaged vessel is sold by court order in a civil
    action in rem, any prior claim in the vessel is terminated -
    including any possessory common law lien. This subsection makes a
    substantive change to law by making the process the same for
    maritime liens as was provided for preferred mortgage liens. This
    eliminates the requirement for making a new mortgagee for a court
    sale to enforce a maritime lien. This section also broadens the
    jurisdiction to courts in the territories, as defined in section
    31301.
      Section 31326(b)(1) provides that each of these terminated claims
    attaches, in the same amount and priority, to the proceeds of sale -
     except that the preferred mortgage lien always has priority over
    these other claims. However, the preferred mortgage lien is still
    subordinated to expenses and fees allowed by the court, costs
    imposed by the court, and any preferred maritime liens. This may
    include statutory fees such as the fee of the United States Marshal
    under 28 U.S.C. 1921. Except for broadening its coverage under
    subsection (a), this makes no substantive change to law.
      Section 31326(b)(2) provides in the case of a foreign vessel, the
    preferred mortgage lien is also subordinated to a maritime lien for
    necessaries performed or supplied for the vessel in the United
    States. "Provided" has been substituted for "provided or supplied"
    for consistency in usage. Except for broadening its coverage under
    subsection (a), this paragraph makes no substantive change to law.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Section 31329 sets out certain restrictions on the court sale of
    a documented vessel.
      Section 31329(a) restricts the sale only to a person eligible to
    own a documented vessel under section 12102 of title 46 or to the
    mortgagee, which may be a trustee acting as a holder of a preferred
    mortgage on a documented vessel for the benefit of a person not
    eligible to be the holder of a preferred mortgage on that vessel.
      Section 31329(b) sets out conditions on the sale to a trustee
    acting as a holder of a preferred mortgage on a documented vessel
    for the benefit of a person not eligible to be the holder of a
    preferred mortgage on that vessel. First, the vessel must be held
    by the trustee for resale. Second, while being held for resale, the
    vessel is subject to requisition or purchase during a national
    emergency under section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46
    App. U.S.C. 1242). And third, the sale of the vessel to the trustee
    is not a sale foreign within the terms of the First Proviso of
    section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883).
      Section 31329(c) requires a person that is eligible to document
    the vessel that purchases a vessel from the court to document the
    vessel. This subsection also requires the person purchasing the
    vessel from the trustee to document it, thereby restricting to whom
    the trustee can sell the vessel. Many documented vessels have no
    national defense utility, such as recreational vessels and fishing
    vessels. Therefore, both of these restrictions can be waived by the
    Secretary. As previously discussed, these waivers can be on a case-
    by-case basis or with a blanket waiver.
      Section 31329(d) prohibits a trustee from operating the vessel
    without the approval of the Secretary.
      Section 31329(e) voids any sale that is done contrary to this
    section.

                           HOUSE FLOOR STATEMENT                       
      Under section 31329(d) a vessel may be operated by the trustee
    only with the approval of the Secretary. Under current law a vessel
    may be documented by a trust if all of the members of the trust are
    citizens of the United States. If the trust buying the vessel at
    the court sale includes foreign investors, the vessel cannot be
    documented. The Committee intends in this section that the vessel
    will only be "operated" in a maintenance manner, but not in a
    commercial service.

                                AMENDMENTS

    disclosing obligations, incurring contractual obligations in
    violation of section 31323(b), and filing a mortgage made not in
    good faith. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by
    adding civil penalties and by making it a crime to record with the
    Secretary of Transportation a mortgage made not in good faith with
    the intent to hinder an existing or future creditor of the
    mortgagor or a lienor of the vessel. This is done since the
    affidavit of good faith has been eliminated from the elements of a
    preferred mortgage.
      Section 31330(b) adds criminal and civil penalties for violating
    the sale and trust requirements under sections 31328 and 31329. It
    also makes a vessel and its equipment involved in those violations
    subject to seizure by the Government.
      Section 31330(c) makes the president or chief executive officer
    of a corporation or association liable as a mortgagor for the
    penalties under this section.

    for a preferred mortgagor's failure to carry out certain
    requirements under chapter 313 of title 46 (as enacted by this
    Act).

    Sec. 31343. Recording and discharging notices of claim of maritime
      lien

-STATUTE-
      (a) Except as provided under subsection (d) of this section, a
    person claiming a lien on a vessel documented, or for which an
    application for documentation has been filed, under chapter 121 may
    record with the Secretary a notice of that person's lien claim on
    the vessel. To be recordable, the notice must - 
        (1) state the nature of the lien;
        (2) state the date the lien was established;
        (3) state the amount of the lien;
        (4) state the name and address of the person; and
        (5) be signed and acknowledged.

      (b)(1) The Secretary shall record a notice complying with
    subsection (a) of this section if, when the notice is presented to
    the Secretary for recording, the person having the claim files with
    the notice a declaration stating the following:
        (A) The information in the notice is true and correct to the
      best of the knowledge, information, and belief of the individual
      who signed it.
        (B) A copy of the notice, as presented for recordation, has
      been sent to each of the following:
          (i) The owner of the vessel.
          (ii) Each person that recorded under subsection (a) of this
        section an unexpired notice of a claim of an undischarged lien
        on the vessel.
          (iii) The mortgagee of each mortgage filed or recorded under
        section 31321 of this title that is an undischarged mortgage on
        the vessel.

      (2) A declaration under this subsection filed by a person that is
    not an individual must be signed by the president, member, partner,
    trustee, or other individual authorized to execute the declaration
    on behalf of the person.
      (c)(1) On full and final discharge of the indebtedness that is
    the basis for a notice of claim of lien recorded under subsection
    (b) of this section, the person having the claim shall provide the
    Secretary with an acknowledged certificate of discharge of the
    indebtedness. The Secretary shall record the certificate.
      (2) The district courts of the United States shall have
    jurisdiction over a civil action in Admiralty to declare that a
    vessel is not subject to a lien claimed under subsection (b) of
    this section, or that the vessel is not subject to the notice of
    claim of lien, or both, regardless of the amount in controversy or
    the citizenship of the parties. Venue in such an action shall be in
    the district where the vessel is found or where the claimant
    resides or where the notice of claim of lien is recorded. The court
    may award costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party, unless
    the court finds that the position of the other party was
    substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of
    costs and attorneys fees unjust. The Secretary shall record any
    such declaratory order.
      (d) A person claiming a lien on a vessel covered by a preferred
    mortgage under section 31322(d) of this title must record and
    discharge the lien as provided by the law of the State in which the
    vessel is titled.
      (e) A notice of claim of lien recorded under subsection (b) of
    this section shall expire 3 years after the date the lien was
    established, as such date is stated in the notice under subsection
    (a) of this section.
      (f) This section does not alter in any respect the law pertaining
    to the establishment of a maritime lien, the remedy provided by
    such a lien, or the defenses thereto, including any defense under
    the doctrine of laches.

      Section 31343 provides that any person claiming a lien on a
    vessel covered by a preferred mortgage may record a notice of lien.
    This notice must state the nature of the lien, date it was
    established; the amount; and the name and address of the person
    claiming a lien, and it must be acknowledged. The Secretary must
    record a notice of lien if it complies with these requirements.
    When any part of the indebtedness is discharged, the claimant shall
    provide the Secretary with a written, acknowledged certificate of
    discharge of the indebtedness, and the Secretary shall record the
    certificate. This section makes no substantive change to law.
      Section 31343(c) provides that, on the full and final discharge
    of an indebtedness that is the basis for a claim, the person having
    the claim shall provide the Secretary with an acknowledged
    certificate of discharge on the request of the Secretary or owner
    of the vessel. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by
    not requiring partial discharges to be filed, as well as making the
    filing of discharge certificates only at the request of the
    Secretary or owner of the vessel.

      In the definition of "service contract", the words "The contract
    may also specify provisions in the event of nonperformance on the
    part of any party" are omitted as unnecessary and inappropriate for
    a definition.
      In the definition of "shipper", the words "non-vessel-operating
    common carrier" are substituted for "ocean transportation
    intermediary, as defined in paragraph (17)(B) of this section"
    because paragraph (17)(B) contains a definition of "non-vessel-
    operating common carrier" which is restated as a separate
    definition.
      The definition of "Commission" is omitted because the full name
    of the Federal Maritime Commission is used the first time the
    Commission is referred to in each section. The definition of
    "person" is omitted as unnecessary because of 1 U.S.C. 1. The
    definition of "United States" is omitted because the term is
    defined in chapter 1 of the revised title for purposes of the

        engaging in negotiations for a service contract with a shipper;
          (B) require a member of the agreement to disclose a

      may provide authority to adopt voluntary guidelines relating to
      the terms and procedures of an agreement member's service
      contracts if the guidelines explicitly state the right of members
      of the agreement not to follow the guidelines. Any guidelines
      adopted shall be submitted confidentially to the Federal Maritime
      Commission.

      (b) Conference Agreements. - Each conference agreement must - 
        (1) state its purpose;

        malpractices;

        (7) establish procedures for promptly and fairly considering
      requests and complaints of shippers; and
        (8) provide that - 
          (A) any member of the conference may take independent action
        on a rate or service item on not more than 5 days' notice to
        the conference; and
          (B) except for an exempt commodity not published in the
        conference tariff, the conference will include the new rate or
        service item in its tariff for use by that member, effective no
        later than 5 days after receipt of the notice, and by any other
        member that notifies the conference that it elects to adopt the
        independent rate or service item on or after its effective
        date, in lieu of the existing conference tariff provision for
        that rate or service item.

    with the Federal Maritime Commission and is effective on filing.
      (b) Complaints. - If a complaint is filed with the Commission

    final decision by awarding prospective credits or debits to future
    assessments and charges. However, if the complainant has ceased
    activities subject to the assessment or charge, the Commission may

    Sec. 40307. Exemption from antitrust laws

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The antitrust laws do not apply to - 
        (1) an agreement (including an assessment agreement) that has
      been filed and is effective under this chapter;
        (2) an agreement that is exempt under section 40103 of this
      title from any requirement of this part;
        (3) an agreement or activity within the scope of this part,
      whether permitted under or prohibited by this part, undertaken or
      entered into with a reasonable basis to conclude that it is - 
          (A) pursuant to an agreement on file with the Federal
        Maritime Commission and in effect when the activity takes
        place; or
          (B) exempt under section 40103 of this title from any filing
        or publication requirement of this part;

        (4) an agreement or activity relating to transportation
      services within or between foreign countries, whether or not via
      the United States, unless the agreement or activity has a direct,
      substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the commerce of
      the United States;
        (5) an agreement or activity relating to the foreign inland
      segment of through transportation that is part of transportation
      provided in a United States import or export trade;
        (6) an agreement or activity to provide wharfage, dock,
      warehouse, or other terminal facilities outside the United
      States; or
        (7) an agreement, modification, or cancellation approved before
      June 18, 1984, by the Commission under section 15 of the Shipping
      Act, 1916, or permitted under section 14b of that Act, and any
      properly published tariff, rate, fare, or charge, or
      classification, rule, or regulation explanatory thereof
      implementing that agreement, modification, or cancellation.

      (b) Exceptions. - This part does not extend antitrust immunity to
    - 
        (1) an agreement with or among air carriers, rail carriers,
      motor carriers, or common carriers by water not subject to this
      part relating to transportation within the United States;
        (2) a discussion or agreement among common carriers subject to
      this part relating to the inland divisions (as opposed to the
      inland portions) of through rates within the United States;

      establish, operate, or maintain a marine terminal in the United
      States; or
        (4) a loyalty contract.

      (c) Retroactive Effect of Determinations. - A determination by an
    agency or court that results in the denial or removal of the
    immunity to the antitrust laws under subsection (a) does not remove
    or alter the antitrust immunity for the period before the
    determination.
      (d) Relief Under Clayton Act. - A person may not recover damages
    under section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15), or obtain
    injunctive relief under section 16 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 26), for

        (1) In general. - Each common carrier and conference shall keep
      open to public inspection in an automated tariff system, tariffs
      showing all its rates, charges, classifications, rules, and
      practices between all points or ports on its own route and on any
      through transportation route that has been established. However,
      a common carrier is not required to state separately or otherwise
      reveal in tariffs the inland divisions of a through rate.
        (2) Exceptions. - Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to
      bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new assembled
      motor vehicles, waste paper, or paper waste.

      (b) Contents of Tariffs. - A tariff under subsection (a) shall - 
        (1) state the places between which cargo will be carried;
        (2) list each classification of cargo in use;
        (3) state the level of compensation, if any, of any ocean
      freight forwarder by a carrier or conference;
        (4) state separately each terminal or other charge, privilege,
      or facility under the control of the carrier or conference and
      any rules that in any way change, affect, or determine any part
      or the total of the rates or charges;
        (5) include sample copies of any bill of lading, contract of
      affreightment, or other document evidencing the transportation
      agreement; and
        (6) include copies of any loyalty contract, omitting the
      shipper's name.

      (c) Electronic Access. - A tariff under subsection (a) shall be
    made available electronically to any person, without time,
    quantity, or other limitation, through appropriate access from
    remote locations. A reasonable fee may be charged for such access,
    except that no fee may be charged for access by a Federal agency.
      (d) Time-Volume Rates. - A rate contained in a tariff under
    subsection (a) may vary with the volume of cargo offered over a
    specified period of time.
      (e) Effective Dates. - 
        (1) Increases. - A new or initial rate or change in an existing
      rate that results in an increased cost to a shipper may not
      become effective earlier than 30 days after publication. However,
      for good cause, the Federal Maritime Commission may allow the
      rate to become effective sooner.
        (2) Decreases. - A change in an existing rate that results in a
      decreased cost to a shipper may become effective on publication.

      (f) Marine Terminal Operator Schedules. - A marine terminal
    operator may make available to the public a schedule of rates,
    regulations, and practices, including limitations of liability for
    cargo loss or damage, pertaining to receiving, delivering,
    handling, or storing property at its marine terminal. Any such
    schedule made available to the public is enforceable by an
    appropriate court as an implied contract without proof of actual
    knowledge of its provisions.
      (g) Regulations. - 
        (1) In general. - The Commission shall by regulation prescribe
      the requirements for the accessibility and accuracy of automated
      tariff systems established under this section. The Commission,
      after periodic review, may prohibit the use of any automated
      tariff system that fails to meet the requirements established
      under this section.
        (2) Remote terminals. - The Commission may not require a common
      carrier to provide a remote terminal for electronic access under
      subsection (c).
        (3) Marine terminal operator schedules. - The Commission shall
      by regulation prescribe the form and manner in which marine
      terminal operator schedules authorized by this section shall be
      published.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 40502. Service contracts

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - An individual ocean common carrier or an
    agreement between or among ocean common carriers may enter into a
    service contract with one or more shippers subject to the
    requirements of this part.
      (b) Filing Requirements. - 
        (1) In general. - Each service contract entered into under this
      section by an individual ocean common carrier or an agreement
      shall be filed confidentially with the Federal Maritime
      Commission.
        (2) Exceptions. - Paragraph (1) does not apply to contracts
      regarding bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new
      assembled motor vehicles, waste paper, or paper waste.

      (c) Essential Terms. - Each service contract shall include - 
        (1) the origin and destination port ranges;
        (2) the origin and destination geographic areas in the case of
      through intermodal movements;
        (3) the commodities involved;
        (4) the minimum volume or portion;
        (5) the line-haul rate;
        (6) the duration;
        (7) service commitments; and
        (8) the liquidated damages for nonperformance, if any.

      (d) Publication of Certain Terms. - When a service contract is
    filed confidentially with the Commission, a concise statement of
    the essential terms specified in paragraphs (1), (3), (4), and (6)
    of subsection (c) shall be published and made available to the
    general public in tariff format.
      (e) Disclosure of Certain Terms. - 
        (1) Definitions. - In this subsection, the terms "dock area"
      and "within the port area" have the same meaning and scope as in
      the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the
      requesting labor organization and the carrier.
        (2) Disclosure. - An ocean common carrier that is a party to or
      is otherwise subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a
      labor organization shall, in response to a written request by the
      labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the
      following work at a dock area or within a port area in the United
      States with respect to cargo transportation under a service
      contract:
          (A) The movement of the shipper's cargo on a dock area or
        within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area
        or within the port area.
          (B) The assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper's
        cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area.
          (C) The assignment of the carriage of the shipper's cargo
        between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area
        and a rail yard adjacent to the container yard.
          (D) The assignment of container freight station work and
        container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area
        or within the port area.

        (3) Within reasonable time. - The common carrier shall provide
      the information described in paragraph (2) to the requesting
      labor organization within a reasonable period of time.
        (4) Existence of collective bargaining agreement. - This
      subsection does not require the disclosure of information by an
      ocean common carrier unless there exists an applicable and
      otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement pertaining to
      that carrier. A disclosure by an ocean common carrier may not be
      deemed an admission or an agreement that any work is covered by a
      collective bargaining agreement. A dispute about whether any work
      is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the
      responsibility of an ocean common carrier under a collective
      bargaining agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with
      the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective
      bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act (29
      U.S.C. 151 et seq.), and without reference to this subsection.
        (5) Effect under other laws. - This subsection does not affect
      the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this part or any other
      Federal or State law of any collective bargaining agreement or
      element thereof, including any element that constitutes an
      essential term of a service contract.

      (f) Remedy for Breach. - Unless the parties agree otherwise, the
    exclusive remedy for a breach of a service contract is an action in
    an appropriate court. The contract dispute resolution forum may not
    be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier
    or by the government that owns or controls the carrier.

    Sec. 40503. Refunds and waivers

-STATUTE-
      The Federal Maritime Commission, on application of a carrier or
    shipper, may permit a common carrier or conference to refund a
    portion of the freight charges collected from a shipper, or to
    waive collection of a portion of the charges from a shipper, if - 
        (1) there is an error in a tariff, a failure to publish a new
      tariff, or an error in quoting a tariff, and the refund or waiver
      will not result in discrimination among shippers, ports, or
      carriers;
        (2) the common carrier or conference, before filing an
      application for authority to refund or waive any charges for an
      error in a tariff or a failure to publish a tariff, has published
      a new tariff setting forth the rate on which the refund or waiver
      would be based; and
        (3) the application for the refund or waiver is filed with the
      Commission within 180 days from the date of shipment.

      In paragraph (1), the words "an error in a tariff, a failure to

      In paragraph (2), the words "or waive" are added for consistency
    with the reference to a waiver later in the paragraph.

    Sec. 40701. Rates

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - A controlled carrier may not - 
        (1) maintain a rate or charge in a tariff or service contract,
      or charge or assess a rate, that is below a just and reasonable
      level; or
        (2) establish, maintain, or enforce in a tariff or service
      contract a classification, rule, or regulation that results, or
      is likely to result, in the carriage or handling of cargo at a
      rate or charge that is below a just and reasonable level.

      (b) Commission Prohibition. - The Federal Maritime Commission, at
    any time after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may prohibit
    the publication or use of a rate, charge, classification, rule, or
    regulation that a controlled carrier has failed to demonstrate is
    just and reasonable.
      (c) Burden of Proof. - In a proceeding under this section, the
    burden of proof is on the controlled carrier to demonstrate that
    its rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation is just and
    reasonable.
      (d) Voidness. - A rate, charge, classification, rule, or
    regulation that has been suspended or prohibited by the Commission
    is void and its use is unlawful.

    Sec. 40702. Rate standards

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "constructive costs"
    means the costs of another carrier, other than a controlled
    carrier, operating similar vessels and equipment in the same or a
    similar trade.
      (b) Standards. - In determining whether a rate, charge,
    classification, rule, or regulation of a controlled carrier is just
    and reasonable, the Federal Maritime Commission - 
        (1) shall take into account whether the rate or charge that has
      been published or assessed, or that would result from the
      pertinent classification, rule, or regulation, is below a level
      that is fully compensatory to the controlled carrier based on the
      carrier's actual costs or constructive costs; and
        (2) may take into account other appropriate factors, including
      whether the rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation is -
       
          (A) the same as, or similar to, those published or assessed
        by other carriers in the same trade;
          (B) required to ensure movement of particular cargo in the
        same trade; or
          (C) required to maintain acceptable continuity, level, or
        quality of common carrier service to or from affected ports.

    Sec. 40704. Commission review

-STATUTE-
      (a) Request for Justification. - On request of the Federal
    Maritime Commission, a controlled carrier shall file with the
    Commission, within 20 days of the request, a statement of
    justification that sufficiently details the carrier's need and
    purpose for an existing or proposed rate, charge, classification,
    rule, or regulation and upon which the Commission may reasonably
    base a determination of its lawfulness.
      (b) Determination. - Within 120 days after receipt of information
    requested under subsection (a), the Commission shall determine
    whether the rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation may
    be unjust and unreasonable.
      (c) Show Cause Order. - Whenever the Commission is of the opinion
    that a rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation published
    or assessed by a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable,
    the Commission shall issue an order to the controlled carrier to
    show cause why the rate, charge, classification, rule, or
    regulation should not be prohibited.
      (d) Suspension Pending Determination. - 
        (1) Not yet effective. - Pending a determination of the
      lawfulness of a rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation
      in a proceeding under subsection (c), the Commission may suspend
      the rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation at any time
      before its effective date.
        (2) Already effective. - If a rate, charge, classification,
      rule, or regulation has already become effective, the Commission,
      on issuance of an order to show cause, may suspend the rate,
      charge, classification, rule, or regulation on at least 30 days'
      notice to the controlled carrier.
        (3) Maximum suspension. - A period of suspension under this
      subsection may not exceed 180 days.

      (e) Replacement During Suspension. - Whenever the Commission has
    suspended a rate, charge, classification, rule, or regulation under
    this section, the controlled carrier may publish a new rate,
    charge, classification, rule, or regulation to take effect
    immediately during the suspension in lieu of the suspended rate,
    charge, classification, rule, or regulation. However, the
    Commission may reject the new rate, charge, classification, rule,
    or regulation if the Commission believes it is unjust and
    unreasonable.

    shall transmit to the President, concurrently with publication
    thereof, each order of suspension or final order of prohibition
    issued under section 40704 of this title.
      (b) Presidential Request and Commission Action. - Within 10 days
    after receipt or the effective date of a Commission order referred

    Commission to stay the effect of the order if the President finds
    that the stay is required for reasons of national defense or
    foreign policy. The reasons shall be specified in the request. The
    Commission shall immediately grant the request by issuing an order
    in which the President's request shall be described. During a stay,
    the President shall, whenever practicable, attempt to resolve the
    matter by negotiating with representatives of the applicable
    foreign governments.

      under section 41305 of this title;
        (2) may be available to pay any claim against an ocean

      related activities - 
          (A) with the consent of the insured ocean transportation
        intermediary and subject to review by the surety company; or
          (B) when the claim is deemed valid by the surety company
        after the ocean transportation intermediary has failed to
        respond to adequate notice to address the validity of the
        claim; and

        (3) shall be available to pay any judgment for damages against
      an ocean transportation intermediary arising from its

    through court judgments. The regulations shall provide that a
    judgment for monetary damages may not be enforced except to the
    extent that the damages claimed arise from the transportation-
    related activities of the insured ocean transportation
    intermediary, as defined by the Commission.
      (d) Resident Agent. - An ocean transportation intermediary not
    domiciled in the United States shall designate a resident agent in

-HEAD-
    Sec. 40904. Compensation by common carriers

-STATUTE-
      (a) Certification of License and Services. - A common carrier may
    compensate an ocean freight forwarder for a shipment dispatched for
    others only when the ocean freight forwarder has certified in
    writing that it holds an ocean transportation intermediary's
    license (if required under section 40901 of this title) and has - 
        (1) engaged, booked, secured, reserved, or contracted directly
      with the carrier or its agent for space aboard a vessel or
      confirmed the availability of the space; and
        (2) prepared and processed the ocean bill of lading, dock
      receipt, or other similar document for the shipment.

      (b) Dual Compensation. - A common carrier may not pay
    compensation for services described in subsection (a) more than
    once on the same shipment.
      (c) Beneficial Interest Shipments. - An ocean freight forwarder
    may not receive compensation from a common carrier for a shipment
    in which the ocean freight forwarder has a direct or indirect
    beneficial interest. A common carrier may not knowingly pay
    compensation on that shipment.
      (d) Limits on Authority of Conference or Group. - A conference or
    group of two or more ocean common carriers in the foreign commerce
    of the United States that is authorized to agree on the level of
    compensation paid to an ocean freight forwarder may not - 
        (1) deny a member of the conference or group the right, upon
      notice of not more than 5 days, to take independent action on any
      level of compensation paid to an ocean freight forwarder; or
        (2) agree to limit the payment of compensation to an ocean
      freight forwarder to less than 1.25 percent of the aggregate of
      all rates and charges applicable under a tariff and assessed
      against the cargo on which the services of the ocean freight
      forwarder are provided.

      In subsection (a), the words "marine terminal operator, or ocean
    freight forwarder" are added because of 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(3)
    and (5). The words "ocean freight forwarder" are substituted for
    "ocean transportation intermediaries, as defined by section
    1702(17)(A) of this Appendix" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(5) because
    the definition of "ocean transportation intermediary" in section
    1702(17)(A) contains a definition of "ocean freight forwarder"
    which is restated as a separate definition.
      In subsection (b), the words "does not prevent" are substituted
    for "Nothing . . . shall be construed to prevent" to eliminate
    unnecessary words.
      In subsection (c)(1), the words "may give information" are
    substituted for "Nor shall it be prohibited . . . to give
    information" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "firm,
    corporation" are omitted as unnecessary because firms and
    corporations are persons.
      In subsection (c)(2), the words "may not prevent" are substituted
    for "Nor shall it be prohibited . . . to prevent" to reflect the
    probable intent of Congress. The words "but the use of such
    information for any other purpose prohibited by this chapter or any
    other Act is prohibited" are omitted as unnecessary.

      classification, false weighing, false measurement, or any other
      unjust or unfair device or means;
        (2) provide service in the liner trade that is - 
          (A) not in accordance with the rates, charges,
        classifications, rules, and practices contained in a tariff

        of this title, unless excepted or exempted under section 40103
        or 40501(a)(2) of this title; or
          (B) under a tariff or service contract that has been
        suspended or prohibited by the Federal Maritime Commission
        under chapter 407 or 423 of this title;

        (3) retaliate against a shipper by refusing, or threatening to
      refuse, cargo space accommodations when available, or resort to
      other unfair or unjustly discriminatory methods because the
      shipper has patronized another carrier, or has filed a complaint,
      or for any other reason;
        (4) for service pursuant to a tariff, engage in any unfair or
      unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of - 
          (A) rates or charges;
          (B) cargo classifications;
          (C) cargo space accommodations or other facilities, with due
        regard being given to the proper loading of the vessel and the
        available tonnage;
          (D) loading and landing of freight; or
          (E) adjustment and settlement of claims;

        (5) for service pursuant to a service contract, engage in any
      unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates
      or charges with respect to any port;
        (6) use a vessel in a particular trade for the purpose of
      excluding, preventing, or reducing competition by driving another
      ocean common carrier out of that trade;
        (7) offer or pay any deferred rebates;
        (8) for service pursuant to a tariff, give any undue or
      unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or
      unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage;
        (9) for service pursuant to a service contract, give any undue
      or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or
      unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to any port;
        (10) unreasonably refuse to deal or negotiate;
        (11) knowingly and willfully accept cargo from or transport
      cargo for the account of an ocean transportation intermediary
      that does not have a tariff as required by section 40501 of this
      title and a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by
      section 40902 of this title; or
        (12) knowingly and willfully enter into a service contract with
      an ocean transportation intermediary that does not have a tariff
      as required by section 40501 of this title and a bond, insurance,
      or other surety as required by section 40902 of this title, or
      with an affiliate of such an ocean transportation intermediary.

    Sec. 41105. Concerted action

-STATUTE-
      A conference or group of two or more common carriers may not - 
        (1) boycott or take any other concerted action resulting in an
      unreasonable refusal to deal;
        (2) engage in conduct that unreasonably restricts the use of
      intermodal services or technological innovations;
        (3) engage in any predatory practice designed to eliminate the
      participation, or deny the entry, in a particular trade of a
      common carrier not a member of the conference, a group of common
      carriers, an ocean tramp, or a bulk carrier;
        (4) negotiate with a non-ocean carrier or group of non-ocean
      carriers (such as truck, rail, or air operators) on any matter
      relating to rates or services provided to ocean common carriers
      within the United States by those non-ocean carriers, unless the
      negotiations and any resulting agreements are not in violation of
      the antitrust laws and are consistent with the purposes of this
      part, except that this paragraph does not prohibit the setting
      and publishing of a joint through rate by a conference, joint
      venture, or association of ocean common carriers;
        (5) deny in the export foreign commerce of the United States
      compensation to an ocean freight forwarder or limit that
      compensation to less than a reasonable amount;
        (6) allocate shippers among specific carriers that are parties
      to the agreement or prohibit a carrier that is a party to the
      agreement from soliciting cargo from a particular shipper, except
      as - 
          (A) authorized by section 40303(d) of this title;
          (B) required by the law of the United States or the importing
        or exporting country; or
          (C) agreed to by a shipper in a service contract;

        (7) for service pursuant to a service contract, engage in any
      unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates or
      charges with respect to any locality, port, or person due to the
      person's status as a shippers' association or ocean
      transportation intermediary; or
        (8) for service pursuant to a service contract, give any undue
      or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or
      unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to any
      locality, port, or person due to the person's status as a
      shippers' association or ocean transportation intermediary.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - A person that violates this part or a
    regulation or order of the Federal Maritime Commission issued under
    this part is liable to the United States Government for a civil
    penalty. Unless otherwise provided in this part, the amount of the
    penalty may not exceed $5,000 for each violation or, if the
    violation was willfully and knowingly committed, $25,000 for each
    violation. Each day of a continuing violation is a separate
    violation.
      (b) Lien on Carrier's Vessels. - The amount of a civil penalty
    imposed on a common carrier under this section constitutes a lien
    on the vessels operated by the carrier. Any such vessel is subject
    to an action in rem to enforce the lien in the district court of
    the United States for the district in which it is found.

    suspend any or all tariffs of the common carrier, or that common
    carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of which

    suspended, or after its right to use that tariff has been
    suspended, is liable to the United States Government for a civil
    penalty of not more than $50,000 for each shipment.
      (c) Failure To Provide Information. - 
        (1) Penalties. - If the Commission finds, after notice and
      opportunity for a hearing, that a common carrier has failed to
      supply information ordered to be produced or compelled by
      subpoena under section 41303 of this title, the Commission may - 
          (A) suspend any or all tariffs of the carrier or the
        carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of
        which it is a member; and
          (B) request the Secretary of Homeland Security to refuse or
        revoke any clearance required for a vessel operated by the
        carrier, and when so requested, the Secretary shall refuse or
        revoke the clearance.

        (2) Defense based on foreign law. - If, in defense of its
      failure to comply with a subpoena or discovery order, a common
      carrier alleges that information or documents located in a
      foreign country cannot be produced because of the laws of that
      country, the Commission shall immediately notify the Secretary of
      State of the failure to comply and of the allegation relating to
      foreign laws. On receiving the notification, the Secretary of
      State shall promptly consult with the government of the nation
      within which the information or documents are alleged to be
      located for the purpose of assisting the Commission in obtaining
      the information or documents.

      (d) Impairing Access to Foreign Trade. - If the Commission finds,
    after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the action of a
    common carrier, acting alone or in concert with another person, or
    a foreign government has unduly impaired access of a vessel
    documented under the laws of the United States to ocean trade
    between foreign ports, the Commission shall take action that it
    finds appropriate, including imposing any of the penalties
    authorized by this section. The Commission also may take any of the
    actions authorized by sections 42304 and 42305 of this title.
      (e) Submission of Order to President. - Before an order under
    this section becomes effective, it shall be submitted immediately
    to the President. The President, within 10 days after receiving it,
    may disapprove it if the President finds that disapproval is
    required for reasons of national defense or foreign policy.

    Sec. 41109. Assessment of penalties

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - Until a matter is referred to the
    Attorney General, the Federal Maritime Commission may, after notice
    and opportunity for a hearing, assess a civil penalty provided for
    in this part. The Commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with
    or without conditions, a civil penalty.
      (b) Factors in Determining Amount. - In determining the amount of
    a civil penalty, the Commission shall take into account the nature,
    circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed and,
    with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, history of
    prior offenses, ability to pay, and other matters justice may
    require.
      (c) Exception. - A civil penalty may not be imposed for
    conspiracy to violate section 41102(a) or 41104(1) or (2) of this
    title or to defraud the Commission by concealing such a violation.
      (d) Prohibited Basis of Penalty. - The Commission or a court may
    not order a person to pay the difference between the amount billed
    and agreed upon in writing with a common carrier or its agent and
    the amount set forth in a tariff or service contract by that common
    carrier for the transportation service provided.
      (e) Time Limit. - A proceeding to assess a civil penalty under
    this section must be commenced within 5 years after the date of the
    violation.
      (f) Review of Civil Penalty. - A person against whom a civil
    penalty is assessed under this section may obtain review under
    chapter 158 of title 28.
      (g) Civil Actions To Collect. - If a person does not pay an
    assessment of a civil penalty after it has become final or after
    the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the
    Commission, the Attorney General at the request of the Commission
    may seek to collect the amount assessed in an appropriate district
    court of the United States. The court shall enforce the order of
    the Commission unless it finds that the order was not regularly
    made and duly issued.

    Sec. 41302. Investigations

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Federal Maritime Commission, on complaint
    or its own motion, may investigate any conduct or agreement that
    the Commission believes may be in violation of this part. The
    Commission may by order disapprove, cancel, or modify any agreement
    that operates in violation of this part.
      (b) Effectiveness of Agreement During Investigation. - Unless an
    injunction is issued under section 41306 or 41307 of this title, an
    agreement under investigation by the Commission remains in effect
    until the Commission issues its order.
      (c) Date for Decision. - Within 10 days after the initiation of a
    proceeding under this section or section 41301 of this title, the
    Commission shall set a date by which it will issue its final
    decision. The Commission by order may extend the date for good
    cause.
      (d) Sanctions for Delay. - If, within the period for final
    decision under subsection (c), the Commission determines that it is
    unable to issue a final decision because of undue delay caused by a
    party to the proceeding, the Commission may impose sanctions,
    including issuing a decision adverse to the delaying party.
      (e) Report. - The Commission shall make a written report of every
    investigation under this part in which a hearing was held, stating
    its conclusions, decisions, findings of fact, and order. The
    Commission shall provide a copy of the report to all parties and
    publish the report for public information. A published report is
    competent evidence in a court of the United States.

    Sec. 41307. Injunctive relief sought by the Commission

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Violations. - In connection with an investigation
    under section 41301 or 41302 of this title, the Federal Maritime
    Commission may bring a civil action to enjoin conduct in violation
    of this part. The action must be brought in the district court of
    the United States for any judicial district in which the defendant
    resides or transacts business. After notice to the defendant, and a
    showing that the standards for granting injunctive relief by courts
    of equity are met, the court may grant a temporary restraining
    order or preliminary injunction for a period not to exceed 10 days
    after the Commission has issued an order disposing of the issues
    under investigation.
      (b) Reduction in Competition. - 
        (1) Action by commission. - If, at any time after the filing or
      effective date of an agreement under chapter 403 of this title,
      the Commission determines that the agreement is likely, by a
      reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in
      transportation service or an unreasonable increase in
      transportation cost, the Commission, after notice to the person
      filing the agreement, may bring a civil action in the United
      States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the
      operation of the agreement. The Commission's sole remedy with
      respect to an agreement likely to have such an effect is an
      action under this subsection.
        (2) Remedies by court. - In an action under this subsection,
      the court may issue - 
          (A) a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
        injunction; and
          (B) a permanent injunction after a showing that the agreement
        is likely to have the effect described in paragraph (1).

        (3) Burden of proof and third parties. - In an action under
      this subsection, the burden of proof is on the Commission. The
      court may not allow a third party to intervene.

      (c) Failure To Provide Information. - If a person filing an
    agreement, or an officer, director, partner, agent, or employee of
    the person, fails substantially to comply with a request for the
    submission of additional information or documents within the period
    provided in section 40304(c) of this title, the Commission may
    bring a civil action in the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia. At the request of the Commission, the Court -
    
        (1) may order compliance;
        (2) shall extend the period specified in section 40304(c)(2) of
      this title until there has been substantial compliance; and
        (3) may grant other equitable relief that the court decides is
      appropriate.

      (d) Representation. - The Commission may represent itself in a
    proceeding under this section in - 
        (1) a district court of the United States, on notice to the
      Attorney General; and
        (2) a court of appeals of the United States, with the approval
      of the Attorney General.

    Sec. 41309. Enforcement of reparation orders

-STATUTE-
      (a) Civil Action. - If a person does not comply with an order of
    the Federal Maritime Commission for the payment of reparation, the
    person to whom the award was made may seek enforcement of the order
    in a district court of the United States having jurisdiction over
    the parties.
      (b) Parties and Service of Process. - All parties in whose favor
    the Commission has made an award of reparation by a single order
    may be joined as plaintiffs, and all other parties in the order may
    be joined as defendants, in a single action in a judicial district
    in which any one plaintiff could maintain an action against any one
    defendant. Service of process against a defendant not found in that
    district may be made in a district in which any office of that
    defendant is located or in which any port of call on a regular
    route operated by that defendant is located. Judgment may be
    entered for any plaintiff against the defendant liable to that
    plaintiff.
      (c) Nature of Review. - In an action under this section, the
    findings and order of the Commission are prima facie evidence of
    the facts stated in the findings and order.
      (d) Costs and Attorney Fees. - The plaintiff is not liable for
    costs of the action or for costs of any subsequent stage of the
    proceedings unless they accrue on the plaintiff's appeal. A
    prevailing plaintiff shall be allowed reasonable attorney fees to
    be assessed and collected as part of the costs of the action.
      (e) Time Limit on Bringing Actions. - An action under this
    section to enforce an order of the Commission must be brought
    within 3 years after the date the order was violated.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Unfavorable Conditions. - To further the objectives and
    policy set forth in section 50101 of this title, the Federal
    Maritime Commission shall prescribe regulations affecting shipping
    in foreign trade, not in conflict with law, to adjust or meet
    general or special conditions unfavorable to shipping in foreign
    trade, whether in a particular trade or on a particular route or in
    commerce generally, including intermodal movements, terminal
    operations, cargo solicitation, agency services, ocean
    transportation intermediary services and operations, and other
    activities and services integral to transportation systems, and
    which arise out of or result from laws or regulations of a foreign
    country or competitive methods, pricing practices, or other
    practices employed by owners, operators, agents, or masters of
    vessels of a foreign country.
      (b) Initiation of Regulation. - A regulation under subsection (a)
    may be initiated by the Commission on its own motion or on the

    Commission shall request the head of a department, agency, or
    instrumentality of the United States Government to suspend, modify,

    relating to the Public Health Service, the Consular Service, or the
    inspection of vessels.
      (b) Prior Review and Approval. - A department, agency, or
    instrumentality of the Government may not prescribe a regulation
    affecting shipping in the foreign trade (except a regulation
    affecting the Public Health Service, the Consular Service, or the
    inspection of vessels) until the regulation has been submitted to
    the Commission for its approval and final action has been taken by

    Sec. 42104. Information, witnesses, and evidence

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order To Supply Information. - In carrying out section 42101
    of this title, the Federal Maritime Commission may order any person
    (including a common carrier, tramp operator, bulk operator,
    shipper, shippers' association, ocean transportation intermediary,
    or marine terminal operator, or an officer, receiver, trustee,
    lessee, agent, or employee thereof) to file with the Commission a
    report, answers to questions, documentary material, or other
    information the Commission considers necessary or appropriate. The
    Commission may require the response to any such order to be made
    under oath. The response shall be provided in the form and within
    the time specified by the Commission.
      (b) Subpoenas and Discovery. - In carrying out section 42101 of
    this title, the Commission may - 
        (1) subpoena witnesses and evidence; and
        (2) authorize a party to use depositions, written
      interrogatories, and discovery procedures that, to the extent
      practicable, conform to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28
      App. U.S.C.).

      (c) Witness Fees. - Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and
    subject to funds being appropriated, a witness in a proceeding
    under section 42101 of this title is entitled to the same fees and
    mileage as in the courts of the United States.
      (d) Penalties. - For failure to supply information ordered to be
    produced or compelled by subpoena under this section, the
    Commission may - 
        (1) after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend tariffs
      and service contracts of a common carrier or the common carrier's
      right to use tariffs of conferences and service contracts of
      agreements of which it is a member; or
        (2) assess a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day
      that the information is not provided.

      (e) Enforcement. - If a person does not comply with an order or
    subpoena of the Commission under this section, the Commission may
    seek enforcement in a district court of the United States having
    jurisdiction over the parties. If, after hearing, the court
    determines that the order or subpoena was regularly made and duly
    issued, the court shall enforce the order or subpoena.

      In subsections (a) and (b), the words "In carrying out" are

      In subsection (b)(1), the words "subpoena witnesses and evidence"
    are substituted for "by subpoena compel the attendance of witnesses
    and the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence"

    words.
      In subsection (b)(2), the words "conform to the Federal Rules of

      If the Federal Maritime Commission finds that conditions
    unfavorable to shipping in foreign trade as described in section
    42101 of this title exist, the Commission may - 
        (1) limit voyages to and from United States ports or the amount
      or type of cargo carried;
        (2) suspend, in whole or in part, tariffs and service contracts
      for carriage to or from United States ports, including a common
      carrier's right to use tariffs of conferences and service
      contracts of agreements in United States trades of which it is a
      member for any period the Commission specifies;
        (3) suspend, in whole or in part, an ocean common carrier's
      right to operate under any agreement filed with the Commission,
      including any agreement authorizing preferential treatment at
      terminals, preferential terminal leases, space chartering, or
      pooling of cargo or revenue with other ocean common carriers;
        (4) impose a fee not to exceed $1,000,000 per voyage; or
        (5) take any other action the Commission finds necessary and
      appropriate to adjust or meet any condition unfavorable to
      shipping in the foreign trade of the United States.

      In paragraph (1), the words "Secretary of Homeland Security" are
    substituted for "collector of customs at the port or place of
    destination in the United States" because the functions of the
    Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating
    thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by
    section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-
    296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the collector of customs
    previously were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by
    Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, and the office of collector of
    customs previously was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
    1965.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Federal Maritime Commission shall
    investigate whether any laws, rules, regulations, policies, or
    practices of a foreign government, or any practices of a foreign

    services in a foreign country, result in the existence of
    conditions that - 
        (1) adversely affect the operations of United States carriers
      in United States oceanborne trade; and
        (2) do not exist for foreign carriers of that country in the
      United States under the laws of the United States or as a result
      of acts of United States carriers or other persons providing
      maritime or maritime-related services in the United States.

      (b) Initiation of Investigation. - An investigation under
    subsection (a) may be initiated by the Commission on its own motion

    investigation under this section and render a decision within 120
    days after it is initiated. However, the Commission may extend this

      treatment at terminals, preferential terminal leases, space
      chartering, or pooling of cargo or revenue with other ocean
      common carriers; and

    agencies of the United States Government prior to taking any action
    under subsection (a).

-STATUTE-
      Subject to section 42306 of this title, whenever the Federal
    Maritime Commission determines that the conditions specified in
    section 42302(a) of this title exist, then at the request of the

        (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall refuse the
      clearance required by section 60105 of this title to a vessel of
      a foreign carrier that is identified by the Commission under
      section 42304 of this title; and
        (2) the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
      operating shall - 
          (A) deny entry, for purposes of oceanborne trade, of a vessel
        of a foreign carrier that is identified by the Commission under
        section 42304 of this title, to a port or place in the United
        States or the navigable waters of the United States; or

      In paragraph (1), the words "Secretary of Homeland Security" are
    substituted for "collector of customs at any port or place of
    destination in the United States" because the functions of the
    Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating

    section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-
    296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the collector of customs
    previously were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by
    Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, and the office of collector of
    customs previously was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
    1965.

    Sec. 50103. Determinations of essential services

-STATUTE-
      (a) Essential Services, Routes, and Lines. - 
        (1) In general. - The Secretary of Transportation shall
      investigate, determine, and keep current records of the ocean
      services, routes, and lines from ports in the United States, or
      in the territories and possessions of the United States, to
      foreign markets, which the Secretary determines to be essential
      for the promotion, development, expansion, and maintenance of the
      foreign commerce of the United States. In making such a
      determination, the Secretary shall consider and give due weight
      to - 
          (A) the cost of maintaining each line;
          (B) the probability that a line cannot be maintained except
        at a heavy loss disproportionate to the benefit to foreign
        trade;
          (C) the number of voyages and types of vessels that should be
        employed in a line;
          (D) the intangible benefit of maintaining a line to the
        foreign commerce of the United States, the national defense,
        and other national requirements; and
          (E) any other facts and conditions a prudent business person
        would consider when dealing with the person's own business.

        (2) Saint lawrence seaway. - For purposes of paragraph (1), the
      Secretary shall establish services, routes, and lines that
      reflect the seasonal closing of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and
      provide for alternate routing of vessels through a different
      range of ports during that closing to maintain continuity of

    products in any foreign port, which products can be carried in dry-
    cargo vessels by reducing rates, by supplying additional tonnage

      In subsection (a), the words "on or before the 1st day of
    December in each year" in 46 App. U.S.C. 811 (last sentence) are
    omitted for consistency with the April 1 date in 46 App.:1118. The
    words "and of the operations of any corporation in which the United
    States is a stockholder, and the names and compensation of all
    persons employed by the Secretary of Transportation" in 46 App.
    U.S.C. 811 (last sentence) are omitted because the provision
    originally applied to the United States Shipping Board (which was
    abolished in 1933) and presumably is not intended to apply to the
    Secretary.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Filing Requirement. - The Secretary of Transportation by
    regulation may require the operator of a vessel in the waterborne
    foreign commerce of the United States to file such report, account,
    record, or memorandum on the use and performance of the vessel as
    the Secretary considers desirable to assist in carrying out this
    subtitle. The report, account, record, or memorandum shall be
    signed and verified, and be filed at the times and in the manner,
    as provided by regulation.
      (b) Civil Penalty. - An operator not filing a report, account,
    record, or memorandum required by the Secretary under this section
    is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of
    $50 for each day of the violation. A penalty imposed under this
    section on the operator of a vessel constitutes a lien on the
    vessel involved in the violation. A civil action in rem to enforce
    the lien may be brought in the district court of the United States
    for any district in which the vessel is found. The Secretary may
    remit or mitigate any penalty imposed under this section.

    Sec. 50302. Port development

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Requirements. - With the objective of promoting,
    encouraging, and developing ports and transportation facilities in
    connection with water commerce over which the Secretary of
    Transportation has jurisdiction, the Secretary, in cooperation with
    the Secretary of the Army, shall - 
        (1) investigate territorial regions and zones tributary to
      ports, taking into consideration the economies of transportation
      by rail, water, and highway and the natural direction of the flow
      of commerce;
        (2) investigate the causes of congestion of commerce at ports
      and applicable remedies;
        (3) investigate the subject of water terminals, including the
      necessary docks, warehouses, and equipment, to devise and suggest
      the types most appropriate for different locations and for the
      most expeditious and economical transfer or interchange of
      passengers or property between water carriers and rail carriers;
        (4) consult with communities on the appropriate location and
      plan of construction of wharves, piers, and water terminals;
        (5) investigate the practicability and advantages of harbor,
      river, and port improvements in connection with foreign and
      coastwise trade; and
        (6) investigate any other matter that may tend to promote and
      encourage the use by vessels of ports adequate to care for the
      freight that naturally would pass through those ports.

      (b) Submission of Findings to Surface Transportation Board. -
    After an investigation under subsection (a), if the Secretary of
    Transportation believes that the rates or practices of a rail
    carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation
    Board are detrimental to the objective specified in subsection (a),
    or that new rates or practices, new or additional port terminal
    facilities, or affirmative action by a rail carrier is necessary to
    promote that objective, the Secretary may submit findings to the
    Board for action the Board considers appropriate under existing
    law.
      (c) Port Infrastructure Development Program. - 
        (1) Establishment of program. - The Secretary of
      Transportation, through the Maritime Administrator, shall
      establish a port infrastructure development program for the
      improvement of port facilities as provided in this subsection.
        (2) Authority of the administrator. - In order to carry out any
      project under the program established under paragraph (1), the
      Administrator may - 
          (A) receive funds provided for the project from Federal, non-
        Federal, and private entities that have a specific agreement
        or contract with the Administrator to further the purposes of
        this subsection;
          (B) coordinate with other Federal agencies to expedite the
        process established under the National Environmental Policy Act
        of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for the improvement of port
        facilities to improve the efficiency of the transportation
        system, to increase port security, or to provide greater access
        to port facilities;
          (C) seek to coordinate all reviews or requirements with
        appropriate local, State, and Federal agencies; and
          (D) provide such technical assistance to port authorities or
        commissions or their subdivisions and agents as needed for
        project planning, design, and construction.

        (3) Port infrastructure development fund. - 
          (A) Establishment. - There is a Port Infrastructure
        Development Fund for use by the Administrator in carrying out
        projects under the port infrastructure development program. The
        Fund shall be available to the Administrator - 
            (i) to administer and carry out projects under the program;
            (ii) to receive Federal, non-Federal, and private funds
          from entities which have specific agreements or contracts
          with the Administrator; and

          completed.

          (B) Credits. - There may be deposited into the Fund - 
            (i) funds from Federal, non-Federal, and private entities
          which have agreements or contracts with the Administrator and
          which shall remain in the Fund until expended or refunded;
          and
            (ii) such amounts as may be appropriated or transferred,
          subject to subparagraph (C), to the Fund under this
          subsection.

          option of the recipient of such amounts, to the Fund and
          administered by the Administrator as a component of a project
          under the program.
            (ii) Prohibition on transfers. - Except as provided in

                (bb) the Department of Transportation agency that
              administers the amounts to be transferred has granted
              project approval for each component of the project that
              is to be funded using such amounts;
                (cc) the Department of Transportation agency that

              project for which funds were approved, and in accordance
              with any conditions governing the amounts under title 23

-STATUTE-
      (a) Authority To Sell. - The Secretary of Transportation may sell
    property (other than vessels transferred under section 4 of the
    Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (ch. 250, 41 Stat. 990)) on terms the
    Secretary considers appropriate.
      (b) Transfers From Military to Civilian Control. - When the
    President considers it in the interest of the United States, the
    President may transfer to the Secretary of Transportation
    possession and control of property described in the second
    paragraph of section 17 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (ch. 250,
    41 Stat. 994), as originally enacted, that is possessed and
    controlled by the Secretary of a military department.
      (c) Transfers From Civilian to Military Control. - When the
    President considers it necessary, the President by executive order
    may transfer to the Secretary of a military department possession

    "such other docks, piers, warehouses, wharves and terminal
    equipment and facilities or parts thereof, including all leasehold
    easements, rights of way, riparian rights and other rights, estates
    or interests therein or appurtenant thereto which were acquired . .

    words "property described in section 17 of the Merchant Marine Act,
    1920 (ch. 250, 41 Stat. 994), as originally enacted" are
    substituted for "property taken over by or transferred to . . .
    under this section", because the first paragraph of section 17 of
    the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, was repealed in 1981 and reference
    to that paragraph is necessary for a complete understanding of
    these provisions. The words "Secretary of a military department"
    are substituted for "War Department or the Navy Department" and
    "Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, or Department
    of the Navy" for consistency with other titles of the United States
    Code. For redesignation of the Department of War to the Department
    of the Army, and for transfer of certain functions to newly
    established Department of the Air Force, see sections 205(a) and
    207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61
    Stat. 501, 502, 503).
      In subsection (b), the words "possessed and controlled by" are
    substituted for "acquired by" for clarity and for consistency in
    the section. The word "best" is omitted as unnecessary.

    Sec. 50305. Appointment of trustee or receiver and operation of
      vessels

-STATUTE-
      (a) Appointment of Trustees and Receivers. - 
        (1) Appointment of secretary. - In a proceeding in a court of
      the United States in which a trustee or receiver may be appointed
      for a corporation operating a vessel of United States registry
      between the United States and a foreign country, on which the
      United States Government holds a mortgage, the court may appoint
      the Secretary of Transportation as the sole trustee or receiver
      (subject to the direction of the court) if - 
          (A) the court finds that the appointment will - 
            (i) inure to the advantage of the estate and the parties in
          interest; and
            (ii) tend to carry out the purposes of this subtitle; and

          (B) the Secretary expressly consents to the appointment.

        (2) Appointment of other person. - The appointment of another
      person as trustee or receiver without a hearing becomes effective
      when ratified by the Secretary, but the Secretary may demand a
      hearing.

      (b) Operation of Vessels. - 
        (1) In general. - If the court is unwilling to allow the
      trustee or receiver to operate the vessel in foreign commerce
      without financial aid from the Government pending termination of
      the proceeding, and the Secretary certifies to the court that the
      continued operation of the vessel is essential to the foreign
      commerce of the United States and is reasonably calculated to
      carry out the purposes of this subtitle, the court may allow the
      Secretary to operate the vessel, either directly or through a
      managing agent or operator employed by the Secretary. The
      Secretary must agree to comply with terms imposed by the court
      sufficient to protect the parties in interest. The Secretary also
      must agree to pay all operating losses resulting from the
      operation. The operation shall be for the account of the trustee
      or receiver.
        (2) Payment of operating losses and other amounts. - The
      Secretary has no claim against the corporation, its estate, or
      its assets for operating losses paid by the Secretary, but the
      Secretary may pay amounts for depreciation the Secretary
      considers reasonable and other amounts the court considers just.
      The payment of operating losses and the other amounts and
      compliance with terms imposed by the court shall be in
      satisfaction of any claim against the Secretary resulting from
      the operation of the vessel.
        (3) Deemed operation by government. - A vessel operated by the
      Secretary under this subsection is deemed to be a vessel operated
      by the United States under chapter 309 of this title.

      State;
        (2) its chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the

        (2) the majority of the voting power in the corporation is
      vested in citizens of the United States;

        (4) there is no other means by which control of the corporation
      is given to or permitted to be exercised by a person not a
      citizen of the United States.

      (d) Determination of 75 Percent Corporate Interest. - At least 75
    percent of the interest in a corporation is owned by citizens of

      any trust or fiduciary obligation in favor of a person not a
      citizen of the United States;

      In subsection (a), the words "and with respect to a corporation
    under subchapter VI of this chapter, all directors of the
    corporation are citizens of the United States" in 46 App. U.S.C.
    1244(c) are omitted because part A of subchapter VI contains the
    operating-differential subsidy program which, under 46 App. U.S.C.
    1185a, is being phased out, and part B of subchapter VI contains
    the Maritime Security Fleet program which is being repealed
    (effective October 1, 2005) and replaced by chapter 531 of title 46
    as enacted by the Maritime Security Act of 2003. Thus, subchapter
    VI is being omitted from the revised title and will instead appear
    as a note under section 53101. The words "and, in the case of a
    corporation, partnership, or association operating a vessel on the
    Great Lakes, or on bays, sounds, rivers, harbors, or inland lakes
    of the United States the amount of interest required to be owned by
    a citizen of the United States shall be not less than 75 per
    centum" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1244(c) are omitted as covered by the 75
    percent ownership requirement for operation in the coastwise trade.
      In subsection (b)(1), the words "Territory, District, or
    possession thereof" are omitted because of the definition of
    "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

      The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 444 is omitted because section

    of subtitle II of title 46, already contains an exception for
    scientific personnel. Title 53 of the Revised Statutes, referred to

      The definition of "Secretary" is omitted as unnecessary because
    the full title is used the first time the term appears in each
    section.
      In the definition of "merchant marine office", the words
    "documented vessel" are substituted for "vessel . . . which is
    documented under the laws of the United States" because of the
    definition of "documented vessel" in 46 U.S.C. 2101, which is being
    moved to chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In the definition of "State maritime academy", the words "or
    territory of the United States" and "or territories of the United
    States" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of
    "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

    must sign, as a condition of the appointment, an agreement to - 
        (1) complete the course of instruction at the Academy;
        (2) fulfill the requirements for a license as an officer in the
      merchant marine of the United States before graduation from the
      Academy;
        (3) maintain a valid license as an officer in the merchant
      marine of the United States for at least 6 years after graduation
      from the Academy, accompanied by the appropriate national and
      international endorsements and certification required by the

      international voyages;
        (4) apply for, and accept if tendered, an appointment as a
      commissioned officer in the Navy Reserve (including the Merchant
      Marine Reserve, Navy Reserve), the Coast Guard Reserve, or any
      other reserve unit of an armed force of the United States, and,
      if tendered the appointment, to serve for at least 6 years after
      graduation from the Academy;
        (5) serve the foreign and domestic commerce and the national
      defense of the United States for at least 5 years after
      graduation from the Academy - 
          (A) as a merchant marine officer on a documented vessel or a
        vessel owned and operated by the United States Government or by
        a State;
          (B) as an employee in a United States maritime-related
        industry, profession, or marine science (as determined by the
        Secretary of Transportation), if the Secretary determines that
        service under subparagraph (A) is not available to the
        individual;
          (C) as a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed
        force of the United States, as a commissioned officer in the
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or in other
        maritime-related Federal employment which serves the national
        security interests of the United States, as determined by the
        Secretary; or
          (D) by a combination of the service alternatives referred to
        in subparagraphs (A)-(C); and

        (6) report to the Secretary on compliance with this subsection.

      (b) Failure To Complete Course of Instruction. - 
        (1) Active duty. - If the Secretary of Transportation
      determines that an individual who has attended the Academy for at
      least 2 years has failed to fulfill the part of the agreement
      described in subsection (a)(1), the individual may be ordered by
      the Secretary of Defense to serve on active duty in one of the
      armed forces of the United States for a period of not more than 2
      years. In cases of hardship as determined by the Secretary of
      Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation may waive this
      paragraph in whole or in part.
        (2) Recovery of cost. - If the Secretary of Defense is unable
      or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under
      paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines
      that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better
      serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of
      Transportation may recover from the individual the cost of
      education provided by the Government.

      (c) Failure To Carry Out Other Requirements. - 
        (1) Active duty. - If the Secretary of Transportation
      determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of
      the agreement described in subsection (a)(2)-(6), the individual
      may be ordered to serve on active duty for a period of at least 3
      years but not more than the unexpired period (as determined by
      the Secretary) of the service required by subsection (a)(5). The
      Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary
      of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual shall
      serve. In cases of hardship as determined by the Secretary of
      Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation may waive this
      paragraph in whole or in part.
        (2) Recovery of cost. - If the Secretary of Defense is unable
      or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under
      paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines
      that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better
      serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of
      Transportation may recover from the individual the cost of
      education provided. The Secretary may reduce the amount to be
      recovered to reflect partial performance of service obligations
      and other factors the Secretary determines merit a reduction.

      (d) Actions To Recover Cost. - To aid in the recovery of the cost
    of education provided by the Government under a commitment
    agreement under this section, the Secretary of Transportation may -
    
        (1) request the Attorney General to bring a civil action
      against the individual; and
        (2) make use of the Federal debt collection procedures in
      chapter 176 of title 28 or other applicable administrative
      remedies.

      (e) Alternative Service. - 
        (1) Service as commissioned officer. - An individual who, for
      the 5-year period following graduation from the Academy, serves
      as a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed force of the
      United States or as a commissioned officer of the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Public Health
      Service shall be excused from the requirements of paragraphs (3)
      through (5) of subsection (a).
        (2) Modification or waiver. - The Secretary may modify or waive
      any of the terms and conditions set forth in subsection (a)
      through the imposition of alternative service requirements.

      (f) Service Obligation Performance Reporting Requirement. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to any otherwise applicable
      restrictions on disclosure in section 552a of title 5, the
      Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the department in which
      the Coast Guard is operating, the Administrator of the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Surgeon General
      of the Public Health Service - 
          (A) shall report the status of obligated service of an
        individual graduate of the Academy upon request of the
        Secretary; and
          (B) may, in their discretion, notify the Secretary of any
        failure of the graduate to perform the graduate's duties,
        either on active duty or in the Ready Reserve component of
        their respective service, or as a commissioned officer of the
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Public
        Health Service, respectively.

        (2) Information to be provided. - A report or notice under
      paragraph (1) shall identify any graduate determined to have
      failed to comply with service obligation requirements and provide
      all required information as to why such graduate failed to
      comply.
        (3) Considered as in default. - Upon receipt of such a report
      or notice, such graduate may be considered to be in default of
      the graduate's service obligations by the Secretary, and subject
      to all remedies the Secretary may have with respect to such a
      default.

      In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "after the
    date occurring 6 months after October 1, 1981" are omitted as
    obsolete. In paragraph (2), the words "before graduating" are
    substituted for "on or before the date of graduation" to eliminate
    unnecessary words. In paragraph (5)(A), the words "or territories"
    are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "State" in
    chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In subsection (d), the words "bring a civil action" are

    may provide to a State maritime academy, for use as a training
    vessel, a suitable vessel under the control of the Secretary or

    vessel is not available, the Secretary may build and provide a
    suitable vessel.
      (c) Approval Requirements. - The Secretary may provide a vessel
    under this section only if - 
        (1) an application has been made under subsection (a);
        (2) the State maritime academy satisfies section 51506(a) of
      this title; and
        (3) a suitable port will be available for the safe mooring of
      the vessel while the academy is using the vessel.

      (d) Preparation and Maintenance. - A vessel provided under this
    section shall be - 
        (1) repaired, reconditioned, and equipped (with all apparel,
      charts, books, and instruments of navigation) as necessary for
      use as a training vessel; and
        (2) maintained in good repair by the Secretary.

      (e) Agency Vessels. - An agency may provide to the Secretary, for
    use by a State maritime academy, a vessel (including equipment)
    that - 
        (1) is suitable for training purposes; and
        (2) can be provided without detriment to the service to which
      the vessel is assigned.

      (f) Fuel Costs. - 
        (1) In general. - Subject to the availability of
      appropriations, the Secretary shall pay to each State maritime
      academy the costs of fuel used by a vessel provided under this
      section while used for training.
        (2) Maximum amounts. - The amount of the payment to a State
      maritime academy under paragraph (1) may not exceed - 
          (A) $100,000 for fiscal year 2006;
          (B) $200,000 for fiscal year 2007; and

        thereafter.

      (g) Removing Vessels From Service and Vessel Sharing. - The
    Secretary may not - 
        (1) take a vessel, currently in use as a training vessel under
      this section, out of service to implement an alternative program
      (including vessel sharing) unless the vessel is incapable of
      being maintained in good repair as required by subsection (d); or
        (2) implement a program requiring a State maritime academy to
      share its training vessel with another State maritime academy,
      except with the express consent of Congress.

    Sec. 51509. Student incentive payment agreements

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - If a State maritime academy has an
    agreement with the Secretary of Transportation under section 51505
    of this title, the Secretary may make an agreement with a student
    at the academy who is a citizen of the United States to make
    student incentive payments to the individual. An agreement with a
    student may not be effective for more than 4 academic years. The
    Secretary shall allocate payments under this section among the
    various State maritime academies in an equitable manner.
      (b) Payments. - Payments under an agreement under this section
    shall be equal to $8,000 each academic year and be paid in such
    installments as the Secretary shall determine while the individual
    is attending the academy, as prescribed by the Secretary. The
    payments shall be used for uniforms, tuition, books, and
    subsistence.
      (c) Enlisted Reserve Status. - An agreement under this section
    shall require the student to accept enlisted reserve status in the
    Navy Reserve (including the Merchant Marine Reserve, Navy Reserve)
    or the Coast Guard Reserve before receiving any payments under the
    agreement.
      (d) Agreement Requirements. - An agreement under this section
    shall require the student to - 
        (1) complete the course of instruction at the academy the
      individual is attending;
        (2) take the examination for a license as an officer in the
      merchant marine of the United States before graduation from the
      academy and fulfill the requirements for such a license within 3
      months after graduation from the academy;
        (3) maintain a valid license as an officer in the merchant
      marine of the United States for at least 6 years after graduation
      from the academy, accompanied by the appropriate national and
      international endorsements and certification required by the
      Coast Guard for service aboard vessels on domestic and
      international voyages;
        (4) accept, if tendered, an appointment as a commissioned
      officer in the Navy Reserve (including the Merchant Marine
      Reserve, Navy Reserve), the Coast Guard Reserve, or any other
      reserve unit of an armed force of the United States, and, if
      tendered the appointment, to serve for at least 6 years after
      graduation from the academy;
        (5) serve the foreign and domestic commerce and the national
      defense of the United States for at least 3 years after
      graduation from the academy - 
          (A) as a merchant marine officer on a documented vessel or a
        vessel owned and operated by the United States Government or by
        a State;
          (B) as an employee in a United States maritime-related
        industry, profession, or marine science (as determined by the
        Secretary), if the Secretary determines that service under
        subparagraph (A) is not available to the individual;
          (C) as a commissioned officer on active duty in an armed
        force of the United States, as a commissioned officer in the
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or in other
        maritime-related Federal employment which serves the national
        security interests of the United States, as determined by the
        Secretary; or
          (D) by a combination of the service alternatives referred to
        in subparagraphs (A)-(C); and

        (6) report to the Secretary on compliance with this subsection.

      (e) Failure To Complete Course of Instruction. - 
        (1) Active duty. - If the Secretary of Transportation
      determines that an individual who has accepted the payments
      described in subsection (b) for a minimum of 2 academic years has
      failed to fulfill the part of the agreement described in
      subsection (d)(1), the individual may be ordered by the Secretary
      of Defense to serve on active duty in the armed forces of the
      United States for a period of not more than 2 years. In cases of
      hardship as determined by the Secretary of Transportation, the
      Secretary of Transportation may waive this paragraph in whole or
      in part.
        (2) Recovery of cost. - If the Secretary of Defense is unable
      or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under
      paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines
      that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better
      serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of
      Transportation may recover from the individual the amount of
      student incentive payments, plus interest and attorney fees. The
      Secretary may reduce the amount to be recovered to reflect
      partial performance of service obligations and other factors the
      Secretary determines merit a reduction.

      (f) Failure To Carry Out Other Requirements. - 
        (1) Active duty. - If the Secretary of Transportation
      determines that an individual has failed to fulfill any part of
      the agreement described in subsection (d)(2)-(6), the individual
      may be ordered to serve on active duty for a period of at least 2
      years but not more than the unexpired period (as determined by
      the Secretary) of the service required by subsection (d)(5). The
      Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary
      of Defense, shall determine in which service the individual shall
      serve. In cases of hardship as determined by the Secretary of
      Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation may waive this
      paragraph in whole or in part.
        (2) Recovery of cost. - If the Secretary of Defense is unable
      or unwilling to order an individual to serve on active duty under
      paragraph (1), or if the Secretary of Transportation determines
      that reimbursement of the cost of education provided would better
      serve the interests of the United States, the Secretary of
      Transportation may recover from the individual the amount of
      student incentive payments, plus interest and attorney fees. The
      Secretary may reduce the amount to be recovered to reflect
      partial performance of service obligations and other factors the
      Secretary determines merit a reduction.

      (g) Actions To Recover Cost. - To aid in the recovery of the cost
    of education provided by the Government under a commitment
    agreement under this section, the Secretary of Transportation may -
    
        (1) request the Attorney General to bring a civil action
      against the individual; and
        (2) make use of the Federal debt collection procedures in
      chapter 176 of title 28 or other applicable administrative
      remedies.

    made therein by the Secretary of Transportation except upon public
    notice of the hearing to be had, and a hearing by the Secretary of

                     CONSTRUCTION-DIFFERENTIAL SUBSIDY                 
      Act June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title V, 49 Stat. 1995, as amended,
    provided as follows:

      SUBSIDY AUTHORIZED FOR VESSELS TO BE OPERATED IN FOREIGN TRADE  
      "Sec. 501. (a) Any proposed ship purchaser who is a citizen of
    the United States or any shipyard of the United States may make
    application to the Secretary of Transportation for a construction-
    differential subsidy to aid in the construction of a new vessel to
    be used in the foreign commerce of the United States. No such
    application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation
    unless he determines that (1) the plans and specifications call for
    a new vessel which will meet the requirements of the foreign
    commerce of the United States, will aid in the promotion and
    development of such commerce, and be suitable for use by the United
    States for national defense or military purposes in time of war or
    national emergency; (2) if the applicant is the proposed ship
    purchaser, the applicant possesses the ability, experience,
    financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the
    operation and maintenance of the proposed new vessel, and (3) the
    granting of the aid applied for is reasonably calculated to carry
    out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act [former 46
    U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section
    101 of this title]. The contract of sale, and the mortgage given to
    secure the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price
    shall not restrict the lawful or proper use or operation of the
    vessel except to the extent expressly required by law. The
    Secretary of Transportation may give preferred consideration to
    applications that will tend to reduce construction-differential
    subsidies and that propose the construction of ships of higher
    transport capability and productivity.
      "(b) The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and
    specifications for the proposed vessel to the Navy Department for
    examination thereof and suggestions for such changes therein as may
    be deemed necessary or proper in order that such vessel shall be
    suitable for economical and speedy conversion into a naval or
    military auxiliary, or otherwise suitable for the use of the United
    States Government in time of war or national emergency. If the
    Secretary of the Navy approves such plans and specifications as
    submitted, or as modified, in accordance with the provisions of
    this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of
    Transportation.
      "(c) Any citizen of the United States or any shipyard of the
    United States may make application to the Secretary of
    Transportation for a construction-differential subsidy to aid in
    reconstructing or reconditioning any vessel that is to be used in
    the foreign commerce of the United States. If the Secretary of
    Transportation, in the exercise of his discretion, shall determine
    that the granting of the financial aid applied for is reasonably
    calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this
    Act, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such application
    and enter into a contract or contracts with the applicant therefor
    providing for the payment by the United States of a construction-
    differential subsidy that is to be ascertained, determined,
    controlled, granted, and paid, subject to all the applicable
    conditions and limitations of this title and under such further
    conditions and limitations as may be prescribed in the rules and
    regulations of the Secretary of Transportation has adopted as
    provided in section 204(b) of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App.
    1114(b), repealed by Pub. L. 109-304, Sec. 19, Oct. 6, 2006, 120
    Stat. 1710]; but the financial aid authorized by this subsection
    shall be extended to reconstruction or reconditioning only in
    exceptional cases and after a thorough study and a formal
    determination by the Secretary of Transportation that the proposed
    reconstruction or reconditioning is consistent with the purposes
    and policy of this Act."

                 CONSTRUCTION OF VESSELS; BIDS; SUBSIDIES             
      "Sec. 502. (a) If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his
    approval under section 501(b) of this Act, and the Secretary of
    Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the
    construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans
    and specifications. If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest
    responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation
    to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may
    approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the
    proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is
    authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for
    the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel,
    and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the
    shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the
    contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund
    hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 505
    of this Act with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of
    Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction
    of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and
    proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the
    shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the
    negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of
    Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and
    reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller
    General of the United States or any of his duly authorized
    representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after
    final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent
    books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its
    subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any
    contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will
    include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect.
    Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder,
    the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a
    contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the
    applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to
    another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of
    Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability,
    experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary
    for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price
    corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary
    of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this Act [former 46
    U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section
    101 of this title], of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.
      "(b) The amount of the reduction in selling price which is herein
    termed 'construction differential subsidy' shall equal, but not
    exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the
    proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in
    the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the
    Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable
    estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the
    construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under
    similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense
    features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which
    is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative
    example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of
    construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed. The
    Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign
    cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has
    been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions. The
    Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or
    recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested
    persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and
    associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements.
    The Secretary's consideration shall include, but not be limited to,
    all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include
    or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his
    determination. The construction differential approved and paid by
    the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of
    constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel
    (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary
    finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the
    foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with
    any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and
    may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence
    of section 505) for the construction, reconstruction, or
    reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a
    cost which will reduce the construction differential to such
    percentage or less. In the event that the Secretary has reason to
    believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall
    report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney
    General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the
    Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the
    Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in
    session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the
    House, respectively.
      "(c) In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the
    Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to
    make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less
    than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the
    purchaser. The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the
    same proportion as provided for the payments on account of the
    construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the
    Secretary of Transportation. The purchaser shall pay, not less
    frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the
    Secretary of Transportation's payments as made to the shipbuilder
    which are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the
    vessel (after deduction of the purchaser's cash payments) at a rate
    not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market
    yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States
    with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average
    maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1
    per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the
    Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs. The
    balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser,
    within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to
    exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which
    shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the
    Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser. Interest at the rate
    per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the
    purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all
    such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.
      "(d) [Repealed. Pub. L. 87-877, Sec. 2(a), Oct. 24, 1962, 76
    Stat. 1200.]
      "(e) If no bids are received for the construction, outfitting, or
    equipping of such vessel, or if it appears to the Secretary of
    Transportation that the bids received from privately owned
    shipyards of the United States are collusive, excessive, or
    unreasonable, and if a citizen of the United States agrees to
    purchase said vessel as provided in this section, then, to provide
    employment for citizens of the United States, the Secretary of
    Transportation may have such vessel constructed, outfitted, or
    equipped at not in excess of the actual cost thereof in a navy yard
    of the United States under such regulations as may be promulgated
    by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Transportation.
    In such event the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay
    for any such vessel so constructed from his construction fund. The
    Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell any vessel so
    constructed, outfitted, or equipped in a navy yard to a citizen of
    the United States for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at
    not less than the cost thereof less the equivalent to the
    construction differential subsidy determined as provided by
    subsection (b), such sale to be in accordance with all the
    provisions of this title.
      "(f) The Secretary of Transportation, with the advice of and in
    coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, shall at least once
    each year, as required for purposes of this Act, survey the
    existing privately owned shipyards capable of merchant ship
    construction, or review available data on such shipyards if deemed
    adequate, to determine whether their capabilities for merchant ship
    construction, including facilities and skilled personnel, provide
    an adequate mobilization base at strategic points for purposes of
    national defense and national emergency. The Secretary of
    Transportation, in connection with ship construction,
    reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under titles V and
    VII [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1191 et seq., see Disposition Table
    preceding section 101 of this title], upon a basis of a finding
    that the award of the proposed construction, reconstruction,
    reconditioning, or remodeling work will remedy an existing or
    impending inadequacy in such mobilization base as to the
    capabilities and capacities of a shipyard or shipyards at a
    strategic point, and after taking into consideration the benefits
    accruing from standardized construction, the conditions of
    unemployment, and the needs and reasonable requirements of all
    shipyards, may allocate such construction, reconstruction,
    reconditioning, or remodeling to such yard or yards in such manner
    as he may determine to be fair, just, and reasonable to all
    sections of the country, subject to the provisions of this
    subsection. In the allocation of construction work to such yards as
    herein provided, the Secretary of Transportation may, after first
    obtaining competitive bids for such work in compliance with the
    provisions of this Act, negotiate with the bidders and with other
    shipbuilders concerning the terms and conditions of any contract
    for such work, and is authorized to enter into such contract at a
    price deemed by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and
    reasonable. Any contract entered into by the Secretary of
    Transportation under the provisions of this subsection shall be
    subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Act, excepting
    those pertaining to the awarding of contracts to the lowest bidder
    which are inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection. In
    the event that a contract is made providing for a price in excess
    of the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted,
    such excess shall be paid by the Secretary of Transportation as a
    part of the cost of national defense, and shall not be considered
    as a part of the construction-differential subsidy. In the event
    that a contract is made providing for a price lower than the lowest
    responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, the construction-
    differential subsidy shall be computed on the contract price in
    lieu of such bid.
      "If, as a result of allocation under this subsection, the
    purchaser incurs expenses for inspection and supervision of the
    vessel during construction and for the delivery voyage of the
    vessel in excess of the estimated expenses for the same services
    that he would have incurred if the vessel had been constructed by
    the lowest responsible bidder the Secretary of Transportation (with
    respect to construction under title V, except section 509) shall
    reimburse the purchaser for such excess, less one-half of any gross
    income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery
    voyage minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce
    such gross income, and such reimbursement shall not be considered
    part of the construction-differential subsidy: Provided, That no
    interest shall be paid on any refund authorized under this Act. If
    the vessel is constructed under section 509 the Secretary of
    Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess,
    less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra
    expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser
    receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage. In the case of a
    vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the
    delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the
    vessel begins loading. In the case of a vessel that is to receive
    operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed
    terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port
    in an essential service. In either case, however, the vessel owner
    shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an
    amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in
    delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to
    the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder. If as a result of
    such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to
    such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for
    such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest
    responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of
    Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel
    was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such
    payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-
    differential subsidy.
      "(g) Upon the application of any citizen of the United States to
    purchase any vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation
    under the provisions of section 215 [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1125,
    see 46 U.S.C. 57105], the Secretary of Transportation is authorized
    to sell such vessel to the applicant for the fair and reasonable
    value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof to the
    Secretary of Transportation less depreciation at the rate of 4 per
    centum per annum from the date of completion, excluding the cost of
    national-defense features added by the Secretary of Transportation,
    less the equivalent of any applicable construction-differential
    subsidy as provided by subsection (b), such sale to be in
    accordance with all the provisions of this title. Such vessel shall
    thereupon be eligible for an operating-differential subsidy under
    title VI of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1171 et seq., see
    Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title],
    notwithstanding the provisions of section 601(a)(1), and section
    610(1) [set out below], or any other provision of law.
      "(h) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to construct,
    purchase, lease, acquire, store, maintain, sell, or otherwise
    dispose of national defense features intended for installation on
    vessels. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to install
    or remove such national defense features on any vessel (1) which is
    in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as defined by section 11(a)
    of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 [50 U.S.C. App. 1744(a)],
    (2) which is requisitioned, purchased, or chartered under section
    902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1242,
    now 46 U.S.C. 56301 et seq.], (3) which serves as security for the
    guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary of Transportation under
    title XI of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1271 et seq., see 46
    U.S.C. 53701 et seq.], or (4) which is the subject of an agreement
    between the owner of such vessel and the Secretary of
    Transportation to install or remove such national defense features.
    Title to such national defense features which the Secretary of
    Transportation determines are not to be permanently incorporated in
    a vessel shall not be affected by such installation or removal
    unless otherwise transferred in accordance with the provisions of
    this title V.
      "(i) The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and
    specifications for such national defense features and the proposals
    for their acquisition, storage, utilization, or disposition to the
    Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestion for such
    changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that
    such features shall be suitable for the use of the United States
    Government in time of war or national emergency. If the Secretary
    of the Navy approves such plans, specifications, or proposals as
    submitted, or as modified in accordance with the provisions of this
    subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of
    Transportation."

    respect to which a construction-differential subsidy is to be
    allowed under this title and its delivery by the shipbuilder to the
    Secretary of Transportation, the vessel shall be documented under
    the laws of the United States, and concurrently therewith, or as
    soon thereafter as practicable, the vessel shall be delivered with
    a bill of sale to the purchaser with warranty against liens,
    pursuant to the contract of sale between the purchaser and the
    Secretary of Transportation. The vessel shall remain documented
    under the laws of the United States for not less than twenty-five
    years, or so long as there remains due the United States any
    principal or interest on account of the purchaser price, whichever
    is the longer period. At the time of delivery of the vessel the
    purchaser shall execute and deliver a first-preferred mortgage to
    the United States to secure payment of any sums due from the
    purchaser in respect to said vessel: Provided, That notwithstanding
    any other provisions of law, the payment of any sums due in respect

    amount which bears the same proportion to the construction-
    differential subsidy paid by the Secretary as such temporary

    Transportation under authority of this title for the construction
    and sale of a new vessel to replace a vessel then operated in
    foreign trade or domestic trade, which in the judgment of the
    Secretary of Transportation should be replaced because it is
    obsolete or inadequate for successful operation in such trade, the
    Secretary of Transportation is authorized, in his discretion, to
    buy such replaced vessel from the owner at a fair and reasonable
    valuation, which valuation shall not exceed the cost to the owner
    or any former owner plus the actual cost previously expended

     VESSELS TO BE OPERATED IN DOMESTIC TRADE; TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
                  CONSTRUCTION AID AND SALE TO PURCHASER
      "Sec. 509. Any citizen of the United States may make application
    to the Secretary of Transportation for aid in the construction of a
    new vessel to be operated in the foreign or domestic trade
    (excepting vessels engaged solely in the transportation of property
    on inland rivers and canals exclusively). If such application is
    approved by the Secretary of Transportation, the vessel may be
    constructed under the terms and conditions of this title, but no
    construction-differential subsidy shall be allowed. The Secretary
    of Transportation shall pay for the cost of national-defense
    features incorporated in such vessel. In case the vessel is
    designed to be of not less than three thousand five hundred gross
    tons and to be capable of sustained speed of not less than ten
    knots, or in the case of a passenger vessel operating solely on the
    inland rivers and waterways which is designed to be of not less
    than one thousand gross tons and to be capable of sustained speed
    of not less than eight knots, or in the case of a ferry operating
    solely in point-to-point transportation which is designed to be of
    not less than seventy-five gross tons and to be capable of a
    sustained speed of not less than eight knots, in the case of an
    oceangoing tug of more than two thousand five hundred horsepower or
    oceangoing barge of more than two thousand five hundred gross tons,
    or in the case of a vessel of more than two thousand five hundred
    horsepower designed to be capable of sustained speed of not less
    than forty knots, the purchaser shall be required to pay the
    Secretary of Transportation not less than 12 1/2  per centum of the
    cost of such vessel, and in the case of any other vessel the
    purchaser shall be required to pay the Secretary of Transportation
    not less than 25 per centum of the cost of such vessel (excluding
    from such cost, in either case, the cost of national defense
    features); and the balance of such purchase price shall be paid by
    the purchaser within twenty-five years in not to exceed twenty-five
    equal annual installments, with interest at a rate not less than
    (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into
    consideration the current average market yield on outstanding
    marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods
    to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans,
    adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an
    allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of
    Transportation to cover administrative costs, the balance of such
    purchase price being secured by a preferred mortgage on the vessel
    sold and otherwise secured as the Secretary of Transportation may
    determine: Provided, That, notwithstanding any other provisions of
    law, the balance of the purchase price of a passenger vessel
    constructed under this section which is delivered subsequent to
    March 8, 1946, and which has the tonnage, speed, passenger
    accommodations, and other characteristics set forth in section 503
    of this Act, may, with the approval of the Secretary of
    Transportation, be secured as provided in such section, and the
    obligation of the purchaser of such a vessel shall be satisfied and
    discharged as provided in such section."

      Act June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title VI, 49 Stat. 2001, as amended,
    provided as follows:

            SUBTITLE A - OPERATING-DIFFERENTIAL SUBSIDY PROGRAM        

    SUBSIDY AUTHORIZED FOR OPERATION OF VESSELS IN FOREIGN TRADE OR IN
                            OFF-SEASON CRUISES
      "Sec. 601. (a) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and
    directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United
    States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels,
    which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign
    commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises
    authorized under section 613 of this title. In this title VI the
    term 'essential service' means the operation of a vessel on a
    service, route, or line described in section 211(a) [now 46 U.S.C.
    50103(a)(1)] or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section
    211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)]. No such application shall be
    approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines
    that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential
    service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote
    the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such
    vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under section 613
    of this title, and that such vessel or vessels were built in the
    United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United
    States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and
    under construction for the account of citizens of the United States
    prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and
    will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size,
    type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to
    enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as
    may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote
    foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability,
    experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary
    to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or
    vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign
    commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to
    place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity
    with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to
    carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act [former
    46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding
    section 101 of this title]. To the extent the application covers
    cruises, as authorized under section 613 of this title, the
    Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last
    determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag
    cruise from the United States competes with any American flag
    cruise from the United States.
      "(b) Every application for an operating-differential subsidy
    under the provisions of this title shall be accompanied by
    statements disclosing the names of all persons having any pecuniary
    interest, direct or indirect, in such application, or in the
    ownership or use of the vessel or vessels, routes, or lines covered
    thereby, and the nature and extent of any such interest, together
    with such financial and other statements as may be required by the
    Secretary of Transportation. All such statements shall be under
    oath or affirmation and in such form as the Secretary of
    Transportation shall prescribe. Any person who, in an application
    for financial aid under this title or in any statement required to
    be filed therewith, willfully makes any untrue statement of a
    material fact, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

    foreign competition, except direct foreign-flag competition, until
    and unless the Secretary of Transportation, after a full and
    complete investigation and hearing, shall determine that an
    operating-differential subsidy is necessary to meet competition of
    foreign-flag ships."

                     CONTRACTS FOR PAYMENT OF SUBSIDY                 
      "Sec. 603. (a) If the Secretary of Transportation approves the
    application, he may enter into a contract with the applicant for
    the payment of an operating-differential subsidy determined in
    accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section,
    for the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service
    and in cruises authorized under section 613 of this title for a
    period not exceeding twenty years, and subject to such reasonable
    terms and conditions, consistent with this Act [former 46 U.S.C.
    App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of
    this title], as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to
    effectuate the purposes and policy of this Act, including a
    performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required
    by the Secretary of Transportation.
      "(b) Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should
    agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-
    differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential
    service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of
    the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost
    of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger
    vessels, as defined in section 613 of this Act, maintenance, and
    repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation
    under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by
    the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the
    same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated
    increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated
    pursuant to the provisions of section 501(b) [set out above]) if
    such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a
    foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the
    vessel or vessels covered by the contract: Provided, however, That
    the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in
    an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section
    211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)], pay, in lieu of the operating-
    differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as
    he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating
    such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels
    under the registry of a foreign country. For any period during
    which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 613 of this Act,
    operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the
    vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel
    is assigned: Provided, however, That if the cruise vessel calls at
    a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is
    served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 613 of this
    Act) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential
    subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its
    assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy
    rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction
    of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port
    shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized
    operator regularly serving the area.
      "(c)(1) When used in this section - 
      "(A) The term 'collective bargaining costs' means the annual
    cost, calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense as of
    any date, of all items of expense required of the applicant through
    collective bargaining or other agreement, covering the employ of
    United States officers and crew of a vessel, including payments
    required by law to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits,
    or similar benefits and taxes or other governmental assessments on
    crew payrolls, but excluding subsistence of officers and crews on
    vessels other than passenger vessels as defined in section 613 of
    this Act and costs relating to:
        "(i) the officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of
      Transportation has found, prior to the award of a contract for
      the construction or reconstruction of a vessel, to be unnecessary
      for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel:
      Provided, That the Secretary of Transportation shall afford
      representatives of the collective-bargaining unit or units
      responsible for the manning of the vessel an opportunity to
      comment on such finding prior to the effective date of such
      finding: And provided further, That in determining whether
      officers or members of the crew are necessary for the efficient
      and economical operation of such vessel, the Secretary of
      Transportation shall give due consideration to, but shall not be
      bound by, wage and manning scales and working conditions required
      by a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement, or
        "(ii) those officers or members of the crew that the Secretary
      of Transportation has found, prior to ninety days following the
      date of enactment of this subsection [Oct. 21, 1970], to be
      unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of the
      vessel.
      "(B) The term 'base period costs' means for the base period
    beginning July 1, 1970, and ending June 30, 1971, the collective-
    bargaining costs as of January 1, 1971, less all other items of
    cost that have been disallowed by the Secretary of Transportation
    prior to ninety days following the date of enactment of this
    subsection [Oct. 21, 1970], and not already excluded from
    collective-bargaining costs under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii) of
    this subsection. In any subsequent base period the term 'base
    period costs' means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of
    United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period
    ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the
    last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or
    decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in
    subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual
    period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-
    bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: Provided,
    That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the
    difference between the base period cost and the collective-
    bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to
    the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the
    collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the
    number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base
    period.
      "(C) The term 'base period' means any annual period beginning
    July 1, and ending June 30 with respect to which a base period cost
    is established.
      "(D) The term 'subsidizable wage costs of United States officers
    and crews' in any period other than a base period means the most
    recent base period costs increased or decreased by the increase or
    decrease from January 1 of such base period to January 1 of such
    period in the index described in subdivision (3) hereof, and with
    respect to a base period means the base period cost. The
    subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any
    period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per
    centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such
    period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-
    bargaining costs.
      "(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the
    collective-bargaining costs on ships in subsidized operation as of
    January 1, 1971, and as of each January 1 thereafter, and shall as
    of intervals of not less than two years nor more than four years,
    establish a new base period cost, except that the Secretary shall
    not establish a new base period unless he announces his intention
    to do so prior to the December 31 that would be included in the new
    base period.
      "(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall compile the index
    referred to in subdivision (1). Such index shall consist of the
    average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for
    employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal
    weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the
    transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry)
    and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural
    industries other than transportation. Such index shall be based on
    the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in
    compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and
    benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining. Such
    materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to
    disclosure.
      "(d) Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an
    opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in
    timely fashion all relevant data within his possession. In making
    the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter
    so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his
    request or on his behalf. Such foreign cost data shall be made
    available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall
    find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining
    such data in the future. In determining foreign manning for
    purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any
    ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined
    until the beginning of a new base period.
      "(e) The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages
    completed during the month, upon the contractor's certification
    that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the
    month. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe procedures
    for the calculation and payment of subsidy on items of expense
    which are included in 'collective-bargaining costs' but are not
    included in the daily rate because they are unpredictably timed.
      "(f) Ninety percent of the amount of the insurance and
    maintenance and repair and subsistence of officers and crews
    subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during
    the month on the basis of the subsidy estimated to have accrued
    with respect to such voyages. Any such payment shall be made only
    after there has been furnished to the Secretary of Transportation
    such security as he deems to be reasonable and necessary to assure
    refund of any overpayment. The contractor and the Secretary of
    Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as
    practicable after such payment. The remaining 10 percent of such
    subsidy shall be payable after such audit."

                       VESSELS EXCLUDED FROM SUBSIDY                   
      "Sec. 605. (a) No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid
    for the operation of any vessel on a voyage on which it engages in
    coastwise or intercoastal trade: Provided, however, That such
    subsidy may be paid on a round-the-world voyage or a round voyage
    from the west coast of the United States to a European port or
    ports or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast to the Orient which
    includes intercoastal ports of the United States or a voyage in
    foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii,
    or an island possession or island territory of the United States,
    and if the subsidized vessel earns any gross revenue on the
    carriage of mail, passengers, or cargo by reason of such coastal or
    intercoastal trade the subsidy payment for the entire voyage shall
    be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the subsidy
    otherwise payable as such gross revenue bears to the gross revenue
    derived from the entire voyage. No vessel operating on the inland
    waterways of the United States shall be considered for the purposes
    of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition
    Table preceding section 101 of this title] to be operating in
    foreign trade.
      "(b) No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the
    operation of a vessel after the calendar year the vessel becomes 25
    years of age, unless the Secretary of Transportation has
    determined, before the date of enactment of the Maritime Security
    Act of 1996 [Oct. 8, 1996], that it is in the public interest to
    grant such financial aid for the operation of such vessel.
      "(c) No contract shall be made under this title with respect to a
    vessel to be operated in an essential service served by citizens of
    the United States which would be in addition to the existing
    service, or services, unless the Secretary of Transportation shall
    determine after proper hearing of all parties that the service
    already provided by vessels of United States registry is
    inadequate, and that in the accomplishment of the purposes and
    policy of this Act additional vessels should be operated thereon;
    and no contract shall be made with respect to a vessel operated or
    to be operated in an essential service served by two or more
    citizens of the United States with vessels of United States
    registry, if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine the
    effect of such a contract would be to give undue advantage or be
    unduly prejudicial, as between citizens of the United States, in
    the operation of vessels in such essential service unless following
    public hearing, due notice of which shall be given to each operator
    serving such essential service, the Secretary of Transportation
    shall find that it is necessary to enter into such contract in
    order to provide adequate service by vessels of United States
    registry. The Secretary of Transportation in determining for the
    purposes of this section whether services are competitive, shall
    take into consideration the type, size, and speed of the vessels
    employed, whether passenger or cargo, or combination passenger and
    cargo, vessels, the ports or ranges between which they run, the
    character of cargo carried, and such other facts as he may deem
    proper."

    under this title shall provide (1) that the amount of the future
    payments to the contractor shall be subject to review and
    readjustment from time to time, but not more frequently than once a
    year, at the instance of the Secretary of Transportation or of the
    contractor. If any such readjustment cannot be reached by mutual
    agreement, the Secretary of Transportation, on his own motion or on
    the application of the contractor, shall, after a proper hearing,
    determine the facts and make such readjustment in the amount of
    such future payments as he may determine to be fair and reasonable
    and in the public interest. The testimony in every such proceeding
    shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the
    Secretary of Transportation. His decision shall be based upon and
    governed by the changes which may have occurred since the date of
    the said contract, with respect to the items theretofore considered
    and on which such contract was based, and other conditions
    affecting shipping, and shall be promulgated in a formal order,
    which shall be accompanied by a report in writing in which the
    Secretary of Transportation shall state his findings of fact; (2)
    that the compensation to be paid under it shall be reduced, under
    such terms and in such amounts as the Secretary of Transportation
    shall determine, for any periods in which the vessel or vessels are
    laid up; (3) that if the Secretary of Transportation shall
    determine that a change in an essential service, which is receiving
    an operating-differential subsidy under this title, is necessary in
    the accomplishment of the purposes of this Act [former 46 U.S.C.
    App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of
    this title], it may make such change upon such readjustment of
    payments to the contractor as shall be arrived at by the method
    prescribed in clause (1) of these conditions; (4) that if at any
    time the contractor receiving an operating-differential subsidy
    claims that he cannot maintain and operate his vessels in such an
    essential service, with a reasonable profit upon his investment,
    and applies to the Secretary of Transportation for a modification
    or rescission of his contract to maintain such essential service,
    and the Secretary of Transportation determines that such claim is
    proved the Secretary of Transportation shall modify or rescind such
    contract and permit the contractor to withdraw such vessels from
    such essential service upon a date fixed by the Secretary of
    Transportation, and upon the date of such withdrawal the further
    payment of the operating differential subsidy shall cease and the
    contractor be discharged from any further obligation under such
    contract; (5) that the contractor shall conduct his operations with
    respect to essential services and any services authorized under
    section 613 of this title, covered by his contract in an economical
    and efficient manner, and (6) that whenever practicable, an
    operator who receives subsidy with respect to subsistence of
    officers and crews shall use as such subsistence items only
    articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, and
    manufacture of the United States, as defined in section 505 herein
    [set out above], except when it is necessary to purchase supplies
    outside the United States to enable such vessel to continue and
    complete her voyage, and an operator who receives subsidy with
    respect to repairs shall perform such repairs within any of the
    United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except in an

    TRANSFER OF VESSELS TO FOREIGN REGISTRY ON DEFAULT OF UNITED STATES

    provisions of this section, may transfer to foreign registry the
    vessels covered by any operating-differential subsidy contract held
    by him, in the event that the United States defaults upon such
    contract or cancels it without just cause. Any contractor desiring
    to transfer any such vessel to foreign registry upon such default
    or cancelation shall file an application in writing with the
    Secretary of Transportation setting forth its contentions with
    respect to the lack of just cause or lawful grounds for such
    default or cancelation. The Secretary of Transportation shall
    afford the contractor an opportunity for a hearing within twenty
    days after such contractor files written application therefor, and
    after the testimony, if any, in such hearing has been reduced to
    writing and filed with the Secretary of Transportation, he shall,
    within a reasonable time, grant or deny the application by order.
      "(b) If any such application is denied, the contractor may obtain
    a review of the order of denial in the United States Court of
    Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court,
    within twenty days after the entry of such order, a written
    petition praying that the order of the Secretary of Transportation
    be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith
    transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of
    Transportation or any officer designated by him for that purpose,
    and thereupon the Secretary of Transportation shall file in the
    court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as
    provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. Upon the
    filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction to determine whether such cancelation or default was
    without just cause, and to affirm or set aside such order. The
    judgment and decree of the court affirming or setting aside any
    such order of the Secretary of Transportation shall be final.
      "(c) No transfer of vessels to foreign registry under this
    section shall become effective until any indebtedness to the
    Government or to any citizen of the United States, secured by such
    vessels, has been paid or discharged, and until after the
    expiration of ninety days from the date of final determination of
    the application or the appeal, if any. Within such ninety-day
    period the Secretary of Transportation may (1) with the consent of
    the contractor purchase the vessels at cost to the contractor plus
    cost of capital improvements thereon, less 4 per centum annual
    depreciation upon such vessel, and the actual depreciated costs of
    capital improvements thereon, or (2) reinstate the contract and

    payment of an operating-differential subsidy has been entered into
    under section 603 of this title effective before January 2, 1960,

    service on the service, route, or line covered by such contract, he
    may amend such contract to agree to pay an operating-differential
    subsidy for operation of the vessel (1) on such service, route, or
    line for some part or no part of each year, and (2) on cruises for
    all or part of each year if such specific cruise is approved by the
    Secretary of Transportation under subsection (e) of this section:

    seven months of each year to ports which are regularly served by
    another United States-flag passenger vessel pursuant to an
    operating-differential subsidy contract.
      "(c) The Secretary of Transportation may authorize passenger
    vessels under operating-differential subsidy contracts to provide

    voyages in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the
    United States without reduction of operating-differential subsidy

    operating in the domestic trades, if he finds that such domestic
    service will not result in a substantial deviation from the
    service, route, or line for which operating-differential subsidy is
    paid and will not adversely affect service on such service, route,
    or line.

    authorized under this section to provide domestic passenger
    services while on voyages in an essential service in foreign
    commerce of the United States -

      passengers' luggage, except between those ports between which it
      may carry mail and cargo on its regular service assigned by
      contract;
        "(2) it may not carry one-way passengers between those ports
      served by another United States carrier on its regular service
      assigned by contract, without the consent of such carrier, except
      between those ports between which it may carry one-way passengers
      on its own regular service assigned by contract;
        "(3) it shall stop at other domestic ports only for the same

      foreign-flag vessel which is carrying passengers who embarked at
      a domestic port, except that a cruise may end at a different port
      or coast from that where it began and may embark or disembark
      passengers at other domestic ports, either when not involving
      transportation in the domestic offshore trade in competition with
      a United States-flag passenger vessel offering berth service
      therein, or, if involving such transportation, with the consent
      of such carrier: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall be
      construed to repeal or modify section 805(a) of this Act [now 46

    suspend its operating differential subsidy contract with all
    attendant statutory and contractual restrictions, except as to
    those pertaining to the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service,

        "(2) the suspension period is not less than twelve months;
        "(3) the operator's financial condition is maintained at a
      level acceptable to the Secretary of Commerce; and
        "(4) the owner agrees to pay to the Secretary, upon such terms
      and conditions as he may prescribe, an amount which bears the
      same proportion to the construction differential subsidy paid by
      the Secretary as the portion of the suspension period during
      which the vessel is operated in any preference trade from which a
      subsidized vessel would otherwise be excluded by law or contract
      bears to the entire economic life of the vessel.

      "(b) The provisions of this section shall be effective for fiscal
    year 1983 only if the President in his annual budget message for
    that year requests at least $100,000,000 in construction
    differential subsidy or proposes an alternate program that would
    create equivalent merchant shipbuilding activity in privately owned

    availability of appropriations, for each subsequent fiscal year
    through the end of fiscal year 2025.
      (b) Vessels Under Charter to United States. - Unless an earlier
    date is requested by the applicant, the effective date for an
    operating agreement with respect to a vessel that is, on the date
    of entry into an operating agreement, on charter to the United
    States Government, other than a charter pursuant to an Emergency
    Preparedness Agreement under section 53107, shall be the expiration
    or termination date of the Government charter covering the vessel,
    or any earlier date the vessel is withdrawn from that charter.
      (c) Termination. - 
        (1) Termination by secretary. - If the contractor with respect
      to an operating agreement materially fails to comply with the
      terms of the agreement - 
          (A) the Secretary shall notify the contractor and provide a
        reasonable opportunity to comply with the operating agreement;
          (B) the Secretary shall terminate the operating agreement if
        the contractor fails to achieve such compliance; and
          (C) upon such termination, any funds obligated by the
        agreement shall be available to the Secretary to carry out this
        chapter.

        (2) Early termination by contractor, generally. - An operating
      agreement under this chapter shall terminate on a date specified
      by the contractor if the contractor notifies the Secretary, by

      termination, that the contractor intends to terminate the
      agreement.
        (3) Early termination by contractor, with available
      replacement. - An operating agreement under this chapter shall
      terminate upon the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on
      the date a vessel begins operating under the agreement, if -

        2 years after the date the vessel begins operating under the
        agreement, that the contractor intends to terminate the
        agreement under this paragraph; and
          (B) the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of
        Defense, determines that - 
            (i) an application for an operating agreement under this
          chapter has been received for a replacement vessel that is
          acceptable to the Secretaries; and
            (ii) during the period of an operating agreement under this
          chapter that applies to the replacement vessel, the
          replacement vessel will be - 
              (I) owned and operated by one or more persons that are
            citizens of the United States under section 50501 of this
            title; or
              (II) owned by a person that is eligible to document the

            person that is a citizen of the United States under section
            50501 of this title.

      (d) Nonrenewal for Lack of Funds. - If, by the first day of a
    fiscal year, sufficient funds have not been appropriated under the
    authority provided by this chapter for that fiscal year, then the
    Secretary shall notify the Committee on Armed Services and the
    Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate
    and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives
    that operating agreements authorized under this chapter for which
    sufficient funds are not available will not be renewed for that
    fiscal year if sufficient funds are not appropriated by the 60th
    day of that fiscal year.
      (e) Release of Vessels From Obligations. - If an operating
    agreement under this chapter is terminated under subsection (c)(3),
    or if funds are not appropriated for payments under an operating
    agreement under this chapter for any fiscal year by the 60th day of
    that fiscal year, then - 
        (1) each vessel covered by the operating agreement is thereby
      released from any further obligation under the operating
      agreement;
        (2) the owner or operator of the vessel may transfer and
      register such vessel under a foreign registry that is acceptable
      to the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Defense,
      notwithstanding section 56101 of this title; and
        (3) if chapter 563 of this title is applicable to such vessel
      after registration of the vessel under such a registry, then the
      vessel is available to be requisitioned by the Secretary of
      Transportation pursuant to chapter 563.

      been approved by the Secretary of Defense.
        (3) Defense measures against unauthorized seizures. - (A) The
      Emergency Preparedness Agreement for any operating agreement that

      piracy shall be equipped with, at a minimum, appropriate non-
      lethal defense measures to protect the vessel, crew, and cargo
      from unauthorized seizure at sea.
        (B) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the

        charges for like transportation resources;
          (B) shall be fair and reasonable considering all
        circumstances;
          (C) shall be provided from the time that a vessel or resource
        is required by the Secretary of Defense until the time that it
        is redelivered to the contractor and is available to reenter
        commercial service; and

      (f) Temporary Replacement Vessels. - Notwithstanding section
    55302(a), 55304, 55305, or 55314 of this title, section 2631 of
    title 10, or any other cargo preference law of the United States -

      foreign-flag vessel or foreign-flag vessel capacity as a
      temporary replacement for a United States-documented vessel or
      United States-documented vessel capacity that is activated by the
      Secretary of Defense under an Emergency Preparedness Agreement or
      under a primary Department of Defense-approved sealift readiness
      program; and
        (2) such replacement vessel or vessel capacity shall be
      eligible during the replacement period to transport preference
      cargoes subject to sections 55302(a), 55304, 55305, and 55314 of
      this title and section 2631 of title 10 to the same extent as the
      eligibility of the vessel or vessel capacity replaced.

        (1) In general. - All commercial transportation resources
      activated under an Emergency Preparedness Agreement shall, upon
      termination of the period of activation, be redelivered to the
      contractor in the same good order and condition as when received,
      less ordinary wear and tear, or the Secretary of Defense shall
      fully compensate the contractor for any necessary repair or
      replacement.
        (2) Limitation on liability of u.s. - Except as may be
      expressly agreed to in an Emergency Preparedness Agreement, or as
      otherwise provided by law, the Government shall not be liable for
      disruption of a contractor's commercial business or other
      consequential damages to a contractor arising from activation of
      commercial transportation resources under an Emergency
      Preparedness Agreement.

    Sec. 53301. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - In this chapter:
        (1) Construction contract. - The term "construction contract"
      includes, for a taxpayer constructing a new vessel in a shipyard
      owned by that taxpayer, an agreement between the taxpayer and the
      Secretary of Transportation for that construction containing
      provisions the Secretary considers advisable to carry out this
      chapter.
        (2) New vessel. - The term "new vessel" means - 
          (A) a vessel - 
            (i) constructed in the United States after December 31,
          1939, constructed with a construction-differential subsidy
          under title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or
          constructed with financing or a financing guarantee under
          chapter 537 or 575 of this title;
            (ii) documented or agreed with the Secretary to be
          documented under the laws of the United States; and
            (iii)(I) of a type, size, and speed that the Secretary
          determines is suitable for use on the high seas or Great
          Lakes in carrying out this subtitle, but not less than 2,000
          gross tons or less than 12 knots speed unless the Secretary
          certifies in each case that a vessel of lesser tonnage or
          speed is desirable for use by the United States Government in
          case of war or national emergency; or
            (II) constructed to replace a vessel bought or
          requisitioned by the Government; and

          (B) a vessel reconstructed or reconditioned for use only on
        the Great Lakes, including the Saint Lawrence River and Gulf,
        if the Secretary finds that the reconstruction or
        reconditioning will promote the objectives of this subtitle.

      (b) Additional Tax-Related Terms. - Other terms used in this
    chapter have the same meaning as in chapter 1 of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1).

      In subsection (a)(2)(A)(i), the words "constructed with a
    construction-differential subsidy under title V of the Merchant
    Marine Act, 1936, or constructed with financing or a financing
    guarantee under chapter 537 or 575 of this title" are substituted
    for "the construction of which has been financed under subchapters
    V or VII of this chapter, or the construction of which has been
    aided by a mortgage insured under subchapter XI of this chapter"
    because of the reorganization of the material and the omission from
    the revised title of the provisions relating to the construction-
    differential subsidy program.
      Subsection (a)(2)(B) is substituted for the source provision to
    state more directly that a vessel described in the source provision
    is a new vessel for purposes of this chapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53306. Recognition of gain for tax purposes

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definitions. - In this section, the terms "net proceeds" and
    "net indemnity" mean the sum of - 
        (1) the adjusted basis of the vessel; and
        (2) the amount of gain the taxpayer would recognize without
      regard to this section.

      (b) Recognition of Gain. - In computing net income under the
    income or excess profits tax laws of the United States, a taxpayer
    does not recognize a gain on the sale or the actual or constructive
    total loss of a vessel if the taxpayer - 
        (1) deposits an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale or
      the net indemnity for the loss in a construction reserve fund
      within 60 days after receiving the payment of proceeds or
      indemnity; and
        (2) elects under this section not to recognize the gain.

      (c) When Election Must Be Made. - 
        (1) In general. - Except as provided in paragraph (2), the
      taxpayer must make the election referred to in subsection (b) in
      the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which
      the gain was realized.
        (2) Receipt after taxable year. - If the vessel is bought or
      requisitioned by the United States Government, or is lost, and
      the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel or indemnity for the
      loss from the Government after the end of the taxable year in
      which it was bought, requisitioned, or lost, the taxpayer must
      make the election referred to in subsection (b) within 60 days
      after receiving the payment or indemnity, on a form prescribed by
      the Secretary of the Treasury.

      (d) Effect of Statute of Limitation. - If the taxpayer makes an
    election under subsection (c)(2), and computation or recomputation
    under this section is otherwise allowable but is prevented by a
    statute of limitation on the date the election is made or within 6
    months thereafter, the computation or recomputation nevertheless
    shall be made notwithstanding the statute if the taxpayer files a
    claim for the computation or recomputation within 6 months after
    the date of making the election.

    Sec. 53310. Obligation of deposits and period for construction of
      certain vessels

-STATUTE-
      (a) Application of Sections 53306 and 53309. - Sections 53306 and
    53309 of this title apply to a deposit in a construction reserve
    fund only if, within 3 years after the date of the deposit (and any
    extension under subsection (c)) - 
        (1)(A) a contract is made for the construction or acquisition
      of a new vessel or, with the approval of the Secretary of
      Transportation, for a part interest in a new vessel or for the
      reconstruction or reconditioning of a new vessel;
        (B) the deposit is expended or obligated for expenditure under
      that contract;
        (C) at least 12.5 percent of the construction or contract price
      of the vessel is paid or irrevocably committed for payment; and
        (D) the plans and specifications for the vessel are approved by
      the Secretary to the extent the Secretary considers necessary; or
        (2) the deposit is expended or obligated for expenditure for
      the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-
      money indebtedness to a person not a parent company of, or a
      company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new
      vessel.

      (b) Additional Requirements for Certain Vessels. - In addition to
    the requirements of subsection (a)(1), for a vessel not constructed
    under a construction-differential subsidy contract or not bought
    from the Secretary of Transportation - 
        (1) at least 5 percent of the construction (or, if the contract
      covers more than one vessel, at least 5 percent of the
      construction of the first vessel) must be completed within 6
      months after the date of the construction contract (or within the
      period of an extension under subsection (c)), as estimated by the
      Secretary and certified by the Secretary to the Secretary of the
      Treasury; and
        (2) construction under the contract must be completed with
      reasonable dispatch thereafter.

      (c) Extensions. - The Secretary of Transportation may grant
    extensions of the period within which the deposits must be expended
    or obligated or within which the construction must have progressed
    to the extent of 5 percent completion under this section. However,
    the extensions may not be for a total of more than 2 years for the
    expenditure or obligation of deposits or one year for the progress
    of construction.

      Subsection (a) is added for clarity because various provisions of
    the source language for this chapter imply that the Secretary is to
    prescribe regulations individually (except for regulations
    affecting a determination of tax liability). See, e.g., 46 App.
    U.S.C. 1177(a) (last sentence), (f)(1) (last sentence), and (l)
    (last sentence).
      In subsection (b), the words "not inconsistent with the foregoing
    provisions of this section, as may be necessary or appropriate" are
    omitted as surplus.

        (2) Preferred stock. - The preferred stock of a corporation is
      deemed to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, even
      though it may not be registered and listed because it is
      nonvoting stock, if the common stock of the corporation satisfies
      the requirements and the preferred stock otherwise would satisfy
      the requirements.

      (c) Maintaining Agreed Percentage. - If at any time the fair
    market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed
    percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of
    amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from
    the fund, shall be made in a way that tends to restore the fair
    market value of the stock to not more than the agreed percentage.

    Sec. 53509. Qualified withdrawals

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Subject to subsection (b), a withdrawal from a
    capital construction fund is a qualified withdrawal if it is made
    under the terms of the agreement and is for - 
        (1) the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of a
      qualified vessel or a barge or container that is part of the
      complement of a qualified vessel; or

      vessel or a barge or container that is part of the complement of
      a qualified vessel.

      (b) Barges and Containers. - Except as provided in regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary, subsection (a) applies to a barge or
    container only if it is constructed in the United States.

    regulations, if the Secretary determines that a substantial
    obligation under an agreement is not being fulfilled, the
    Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing to the person
    maintaining the fund, may treat any amount in the fund as an amount
    withdrawn from the fund in a nonqualified withdrawal.

    Sec. 53510. Tax treatment of qualified withdrawals and basis of
      property

-STATUTE-
      (a) Order of Withdrawals. - A qualified withdrawal from a capital
    construction fund shall be treated as made - 
        (1) first from the capital account;
        (2) second from the capital gain account; and
        (3) third from the ordinary income account.

      (b) Ordinary Income Account Withdrawals. - If a portion of a
    qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made from
    the ordinary income account, the basis of the vessel, barge, or
    container shall be reduced by an amount equal to that portion.
      (c) Capital Gain Account Withdrawals. - If a portion of a
    qualified withdrawal for a vessel, barge, or container is made from
    the capital gain account, the basis of the vessel, barge, or
    container shall be reduced by an amount equal to that portion.
      (d) Withdrawals To Pay Principal. - If a portion of a qualified
    withdrawal to pay the principal on indebtedness is made from the
    ordinary income account or the capital gain account, an amount
    equal to the total reduction that would be required by subsections
    (b) and (c) if the withdrawal were a qualified withdrawal for a
    purpose described in those subsections shall be applied, in the
    order provided in joint regulations, to reduce the basis of
    vessels, barges, and containers owned by the person maintaining the
    fund. The remaining amount of the withdrawal shall be treated as a
    nonqualified withdrawal.
      (e) Gain on Property With Reduced Basis. - If property, the basis
    of which was reduced under subsection (b), (c), or (d), is disposed
    of, any gain realized on the disposition, to the extent it does not
    exceed the total reduction in the basis of the property under those
    subsections, shall be treated as an amount referred to in section
    53511(c)(1) of this title withdrawn on the date of disposition of
    the property. Subject to conditions prescribed in joint
    regulations, this subsection does not apply to a disposition if
    there is a redeposit, in an amount determined under joint
    regulations, that restores the fund as far as practicable to the
    position it was in before the withdrawal.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Except as provided in section 53513 of this
    title, a withdrawal from a fund that is not a qualified withdrawal
    shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.
      (b) Order of Withdrawals. - A nonqualified withdrawal shall be
    treated as made - 
        (1) first from the ordinary income account;
        (2) second from the capital gain account; and
        (3) third from the capital account.

      (c) Tax Treatment. - For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) - 
        (1) a nonqualified withdrawal from the ordinary income account
      shall be included in income as an item of ordinary income for the
      taxable year in which the withdrawal is made;
        (2) a nonqualified withdrawal from the capital gain account
      shall be included in income for the taxable year in which the
      withdrawal is made as an item of gain realized during that year
      from the disposition of an asset held for more than 6 months; and
        (3) for the period through the last date prescribed for payment
      of tax for the taxable year in which the withdrawal is made - 
          (A) no interest shall be payable under section 6601 of such
        Code (26 U.S.C. 6601) and no addition to the tax shall be
        payable under section 6651 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 6651);
          (B) interest on the amount of the additional tax attributable
        to an amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal from the

        paid at the rate determined under subsection (d) from the last
        date prescribed for payment of the tax for the taxable year for
        which the amount was deposited in the fund; and

      (d) Interest Rate. - The rate of interest under subsection

    beginning after 1971 shall be determined and published jointly by
    the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. The rate shall be
    such that its relationship to 8 percent is comparable, as
    determined by the Secretaries under joint regulations, to the
    relationship between - 
        (1) the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year
      immediately before the beginning of the taxable year; and
        (2) the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year
      1970.

      (e) Nonqualified Withdrawals. - 
        (1) In general. - The following applicable percentage of any
      amount that remains in a capital construction fund at the close

      the close of the -                                     percentage
                                                              is -

         28th taxable year                            60 percent            
         29th taxable year                            80 percent            
         30th taxable year                            100 percent.          

        (2) Earnings. - The earnings of a capital construction fund for

        (3) Contract for qualified withdrawal. - Under paragraph (1),
      an amount shall not be treated as remaining in a capital
      construction fund at the close of a taxable year to the extent
      there is a binding contract at the close of the taxable year for
      a qualified withdrawal of the amount for an identified item for
      which the withdrawal may be made.
        (4) Excess earnings. - If the Secretary determines that the
      balance in a capital construction fund exceeds the amount
      appropriate to meet the vessel construction program objectives of
      the person that established the fund, the amount of the excess
      shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under paragraph (1)
      unless the person develops appropriate program objectives within

        (5) Amounts in fund on january 1, 1987. - Under this
      subsection, amounts in a capital construction fund on January 1,

        (1) In general. - For a taxable year for which there is a
      nonqualified withdrawal (including an amount treated as a
      nonqualified withdrawal under subsection (e)), the tax imposed by
      chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1)
      shall be determined by - 
          (A) excluding the withdrawal from gross income; and
          (B) increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 of such Code by
        the product of the amount of the withdrawal and the highest tax
        rate specified in section 1 (or section 11 for a corporation)
        of such Code (26 U.S.C. 1, 11).

        (2) Maximum tax rate. - For that portion of a nonqualified
      withdrawal made from the capital gain account during a taxable
      year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a) of such Code (26 U.S.C.
      1(h), 1201(a)) applies, the tax rate used under paragraph (1)(B)
      may not exceed 15 percent (or 34 percent for a corporation).
        (3) Tax benefit rule. - If any portion of a nonqualified
      withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (except earnings
      on deposits) made by the taxpayer in a taxable year that did not
      reduce the taxpayer's liability for tax under chapter 1 of such
      Code (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) for a taxable year before the taxable year
      in which the withdrawal occurs - 
          (A) that portion shall not be taken into account under
        paragraph (1); and
          (B) an amount equal to that portion shall be allowed as a
        deduction under section 172 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 172) for
        the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs.

        (4) Coordination with deduction for net operating losses. - A
      nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under
      paragraph (1) shall be excluded in determining taxable income
      under section 172(b)(2) of such Code (26 U.S.C. 172(b)(2)).

    Sec. 53514. Relationship of old fund to new fund

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "old fund" means a
    capital construction fund maintained before October 21, 1970.
      (b) Election To Maintain Old Fund. - A person maintaining an old
    fund may elect to continue the old fund, but may not - 
        (1) hold amounts in the old fund beyond the expiration date
      provided in the agreement under which the old fund is maintained
      (determined without regard to an extension or renewal made after
      April 14, 1970); or
        (2) maintain simultaneously the old fund and a new fund
      established under this chapter.

      (c) Application of New Fund Agreement to Old Fund Amounts. - If a
    person makes an agreement under this chapter to establish a new
    fund, the person may agree to extend the agreement to some or all
    of the amounts in an old fund. Each item in the old fund to be
    transferred shall be transferred in a nontaxable transaction to the
    appropriate account in the new fund. For purposes of section
    53511(c)(3) of this title, the date of the deposit of an item so
    transferred shall be July 1, 1971, or the date of the deposit in
    the old fund, whichever is later.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In paragraph (2), the words "but shall not be limited to" are
    omitted as unnecessary.
      In paragraph (4)(B), the words "become or remain" are substituted
    for "be placed under or continued to be" for clarity.
      In paragraph (5)(B)(i), the words "individual who is a citizen of
    the United States" are substituted for "individual who is a citizen
    or national of the United States or a citizen of the Northern
    Mariana Islands" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) because of the
    definition of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the
    revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became
    citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of
    which is a "citizen of the United States" as defined in chapter 1
    of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the
    Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on
    November 4, 1986.
      In paragraph (5)(B)(ii), the words "corporation, partnership,
    association, or other" are omitted as suplus [sic]. The words "the
    term 'State' as used therein includes any State, the District of
    Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the
    Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, the Northern Mariana
    Islands, or any other Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the
    United States" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) are omitted as unnecessary
    because of the definitions of "State" and "United States" in
    chapter 1 of the revised title. The definition of "United States"
    in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(m) is omitted as unnecessary because of the
    definition of "United States" in chapter 1. The words "and
    nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana
    Islands shall be treated as citizens of the United States in
    meeting such ownership requirement" are omitted as unnecessary
    because of the definition of "citizen of the United States" in
    chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In paragraph (8), before subparagraph (A), the words "instrument
    of indebtedness" are substituted for "note, bond, debenture, or
    other evidence of indebtedness" to eliminate unnecessary words. In
    subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for
    the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under
    section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the
    explanation for section 53717.

      guaranteed by the Secretary. A direct loan obligation under this
      subsection shall be treated in the same manner and to the same
      extent as an obligation guaranteed under this chapter except with
      respect to provisions of this chapter that by their nature can
      only be applied to obligations guaranteed under this chapter.
        (2) Interest rate. - Notwithstanding any other provision of
      this chapter, the annual rate of interest an obligor shall pay on
      a direct loan obligation under this subsection is 2 percent plus
      the additional percent the Secretary must pay as interest to
      borrow from the Treasury the funds to make the loan.

              REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS FOR LOANS AND GUARANTEES          
      Pub. L. 110-181, div. C, title XXXV, Sec. 3517, Jan. 28, 2008,
    122 Stat. 595, provided that:
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) The maritime loan guarantee program was established by the
      Congress through the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [see Short Title
      of 1936 Amendment note set out under section 101 of this title]
      to encourage domestic shipbuilding by making available federally
      backed loan guarantees for new construction to ship owners and
      operators.
        "(2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and
      successful history of ship construction with a low historical
      default rate.
        "(3) The current process for review of applications for
      maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has
      effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the
      Congress.
        "(4) The President has requested no funding for the loan
      guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster
      the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant
      marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.
        "(5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a
      competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by
      government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.
        "(6) The maritime loan guarantee program has the potential to
      modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise
      trade and restore a competitive position in the world
      shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.
        "(7) The maritime loan guarantee program is a useful tool to
      encourage domestic shipbuilding, preserving a vital industrial
      capacity critical to the security of the United States.
      "(b) Requirements. - 
        "(1) In general. - Within 180 days after the date of enactment
      of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008], the Administrator of the Maritime
      Administration shall develop and implement a comprehensive plan
      for the review of applications for loan guarantees under chapter
      537 of title 46, United States Code.
        "(2) Deadline for action on application. - 
          "(A) Traditional applications. - In the comprehensive plan
        the Administrator will ensure that within the 90-day period
        following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for
        review of a traditional loan application, the application shall
        be either accepted or rejected.
          "(B) Nontraditional applications. - In the comprehensive plan
        the Administrator will ensure that within the 180-day period
        following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for
        review of a nontraditional loan application, the application
        shall be either accepted or rejected.
      "(c) Submission to Congress. - The Administrator shall submit a
    copy of the comprehensive plan to the Committee on Commerce,
    Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on
    Armed Services of the House of Representatives within 180 days
    after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008].
      "(d) Definitions. - In this section:
        "(1) Traditional application. - The term 'traditional
      application' means an application for a loan, guarantee, or
      commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of
      title 46, United States Code, that involves a market, technology,
      and financial structure of a type that has proven successful in
      previous applications and does not present an unreasonable risk
      to the United States, as determined by the Administrator of the
      Maritime Administration.
        "(2) Nontraditional application. - The term 'nontraditional
      application' means an application for a loan, guarantee, or
      commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of
      title 46, United States Code, that is not a traditional
      application, as determined by the Administrator of the Maritime
      Administration."

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53704. Funding limits

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Limitations. - The total unpaid principal amount of
    obligations guaranteed under this chapter and outstanding at one
    time may not exceed $12,000,000,000. Of that amount - 
        (1) $850,000,000 shall be limited to obligations related to
      fishing vessels and fishery facilities; and
        (2) $3,000,000,000 shall be limited to obligations related to
      eligible export vessels.

      (b) Additional Limitations. - Additional limitations may not be
    imposed on new commitments to guarantee loans for any fiscal year,
    except in amounts established in advance by annual authorization
    laws. A vessel eligible for a guarantee under this chapter may not
    be denied eligibility because of its type.
      (c) Limits Based on Risk Factors. - 
        (1) Definition. - In this subsection, the term "cost" has the
      meaning given that term in section 502 of the Federal Credit
      Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a).
        (2) System of risk categories. - The Secretary or Administrator
      shall - 
          (A) establish, and update annually, a system of risk
        categories for obligations guaranteed under this chapter that
        categorizes the relative risk of guarantees based on the risk
        factors set forth in paragraph (4);
          (B) determine annually for each risk category a subsidy rate
        equivalent to the cost of obligations in the category,
        expressed as a percentage of the amount guaranteed for
        obligations in the category; and
          (C) ensure that each risk category is comprised of loans that
        are relatively homogeneous in cost and share characteristics
        predictive of defaults and other costs, given the facts known
        at the time of obligation or commitment, using a risk category
        system that is based on historical analysis of program data and
        statistical evidence concerning the likely costs of defaults or
        other costs that are expected to be associated with the loans
        in the category.

        (3) Use of system. - 
          (A) Placing obligation in category. - Before making a
        guarantee under this chapter for an obligation, and annually
        for projects subject to a guarantee, the Secretary or
        Administrator shall apply the risk factors specified in
        paragraph (4) to place the obligation in a risk category
        established under paragraph (2).
          (B) Reduction of available amount. - The Secretary or
        Administrator shall consider the total amount available to the
        Secretary or Administrator for making guarantees under this
        chapter to be reduced by the amount determined by multiplying -
        
            (i) the amount guaranteed under this chapter for an
          obligation; by
            (ii) the subsidy rate for the category in which the
          obligation is placed under subparagraph (A).

          (C) Estimated cost. - The estimated cost to the United States
        Government of a guarantee under this chapter for an obligation
        is deemed to be the amount determined under subparagraph (B)
        for the obligation.
          (D) Restriction on further guarantees. - The Secretary or
        Administrator may not guarantee obligations under this chapter
        after the total amount available to the Secretary or
        Administrator under appropriations laws for the cost of loan
        guarantees is considered to be reduced to zero under
        subparagraph (B).

        (4) Risk factors. - The risk factors referred to in this
      subsection are -

        (2) Financing (including reimbursement of an obligor for
      expenditures previously made for) the construction,

      In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "To be
    eligible for a guarantee under this chapter, an obligation must aid
    in any of the following" are substituted for "Pursuant to the
    authority granted under section 1273(a) of this Appendix, the
    Secretary, upon such terms as he shall prescribe, may guarantee or
    make a commitment to guarantee, payment of the principal of and
    interest on an obligation which aids in" to eliminate unnecessary
    words.
      In subsection (a)(2), the words "citizens of the United States"
    are substituted for "citizens or nationals of the United States or
    citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands" because of the definition
    of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the revised
    title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or
    non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a
    "citizen of the United States" as defined in chapter 1 of the
    revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of
    the Northern Mariana Islands became effective November 4, 1986.

    Sec. 53708. Findings related to economic soundness

-STATUTE-
      (a) By Administrator. - The Administrator may not guarantee or
    make a commitment to guarantee an obligation under this chapter
    unless the Administrator finds that the property or project for
    which the obligation will be executed will be economically sound.
    In making that finding, the Administrator shall consider - 
        (1) the need in the particular segment of the maritime industry
      for new or additional capacity, including any impact on existing
      equipment for which a guarantee under this chapter is in effect;
        (2) the market potential for employment of the vessel over the
      life of the guarantee;
        (3) projected revenues and expenses associated with employment
      of the vessel;
        (4) any charter, contract of affreightment, transportation
      agreement, or similar agreement or undertaking relevant to the
      employment of the vessel;
        (5) other relevant criteria; and
        (6) for inland waterways, the need for technical improvements,
      including increased fuel efficiency or improved safety.

      (b) By Secretary. - The Secretary may not guarantee or make a
    commitment to guarantee an obligation under this chapter unless the
    Secretary finds, at or prior to the time the commitment is made or
    the guarantee becomes effective, that - 
        (1) the property or project for which the obligation will be
      executed will be economically sound; and
        (2) for a fishing vessel, the purpose of the financing or
      refinancing is consistent with - 
          (A) the wise use of the fisheries resources and the
        development, advancement, management, conservation, and
        protection of the fisheries resources; or
          (B) the need for technical improvements, including increased
        fuel efficiency or improved safety.

      (c) Used Fishing Vessels and Facilities. - The Secretary may not
    guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation under
    this chapter for the purchase of a used fishing vessel or used
    fishery facility unless the vessel or facility will be - 
        (1) reconstructed or reconditioned in the United States and
      will contribute to the development of the United States fishing
      industry; or
        (2) used - 
          (A) in the harvesting of fish from an underused fishery; or
          (B) for a purpose described in the definition of "fishery
        facility" in section 53701 of this title with respect to an
        underused fishery.

      (d) Independent Analysis. - The Secretary or Administrator may
    make a determination that aspects of an application under this
    chapter require independent analysis to be conducted by third party
    experts due to risk factors associated with markets, technology, or
    financial structures. A third party independent analysis conducted
    under this subsection shall be performed by a private sector expert
    in assessing such risk factors who is selected by the Secretary or
    Administrator.
      (e) Additional Equity Because of Increased Risks. -
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary
    or Administrator may make a determination that an application under
    this title requires additional equity because of increased risk
    factors associated with markets, technology, or financial
    structures.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The principal of an obligation may not be

    multiplying the percentage applicable under subsection (b) by - 
        (1) the amount paid by or for the account of the obligor (as
      determined by the Secretary or Administrator, which determination
      shall be conclusive) for the construction, reconstruction, or
      reconditioning of the vessel used as security for the guarantee;
      or
        (2) if the obligor creates an escrow fund under section 53715
      of this title, the actual cost of the vessel.

      (b) Limitations on Amount Borrowed. - 
        (1) In general. - Except as otherwise provided, the principal
      amount of an obligation guaranteed under this chapter may not

      used as security for the guarantee.
        (2) Certain approved vessels. - The principal amount may not
      exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost
      if - 
          (A) the size and speed of the vessel are approved by the
        Secretary or Administrator;
          (B) the vessel is or would have been eligible for mortgage
        aid for construction under section 509 of the Merchant Marine
        Act, 1936, or would have been eligible except that the vessel
        was built with a construction-differential subsidy and the
        subsidy has been repaid; and
          (C) the vessel is of a type described in that section for

      differential subsidy or for which the subsidy has been repaid,
      the principal amount may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual
      cost or depreciated actual cost.
        (4) Fishing vessels and fishery facilities. - For a fishing
      vessel or fishery facility, the principal amount may not exceed

      plantship.
        (6) Eligible export vessels. - For an eligible export vessel,
      the principal amount may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual
      cost or depreciated actual cost.

      (c) Security Involving Multiple Vessels. - The principal amount
    of an obligation having more than one vessel as security for the
    guarantee may not exceed the sum of the principal amounts allowable
    for all the vessels.
      (d) Prohibition on Uniform Percentage Limitations. - The
    Secretary or Administrator may not establish a percentage under any
    provision of subsection (b) that is to be applied uniformly to all
    guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under that provision.
      (e) Prohibition on Minimum Principal Amount. - The Secretary may
    not establish, as a condition of eligibility for a guarantee under
    this chapter, a minimum principal amount for an obligation covering
    the reconstruction or reconditioning of a fishing vessel or fishery
    facility. For purposes of this chapter, the reconstruction or
    reconditioning of a fishing vessel or fishery facility does not
    include the routine minor repair or maintenance of the vessel or
    facility.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - An obligation guaranteed under this chapter
    must - 
        (1) provide for payments by the obligor satisfactory to the
      Secretary or Administrator;
        (2) provide for interest (exclusive of guarantee fees and other
      fees) at a rate not more than the annual rate on the unpaid
      principal that the Secretary or Administrator determines is
      reasonable, considering the range of interest rates prevailing in
      the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the
      Secretary or Administrator;
        (3) have a maturity date satisfactory to the Secretary or
      Administrator, but - 
          (A) not more than 25 years after the date of delivery of the
        vessel used as security for the guarantee; or
          (B) if the vessel has been reconstructed or reconditioned,
        not more than the later of - 
            (i) 25 years after the date of delivery of the vessel; or
            (ii) the remaining years of useful life of the vessel as
          determined by the Secretary or Administrator; and

        (4) provide, or a related agreement must provide, that if the
      vessel used as security for the guarantee is a delivered vessel,
      the vessel shall be - 
          (A) in class A-1, American Bureau of Shipping, or meet other
        standards acceptable to the Secretary or Administrator, with
        all required certificates, including marine inspection
        certificates of the Coast Guard or, in the case of an eligible
        export vessel, of the appropriate foreign authorities under a
        treaty, convention, or other international agreement to which
        the United States is a party, and with all outstanding
        requirements and recommendations necessary for class retention
        accomplished, unless the Secretary or Administrator permits a
        deferment of repairs necessary to meet these requirements; and
          (B) well equipped, in good repair, and in every respect
        seaworthy and fit for service.

      (b) Provisions for Certain Passenger Vessels. - 
        (1) In general. - With the Administrator's approval, if the
      vessel used as security for the guarantee is a passenger vessel
      having the tonnage, speed, passenger accommodations, and other
      characteristics described in section 503 of the Merchant Marine
      Act, 1936, an obligation guaranteed under this chapter or a
      related agreement may provide that - 
          (A) the only recourse by the United States Government against
        the obligor for payments under the guarantee will be
        repossession of the vessel and assignment of insurance claims;
        and
          (B) the obligor's liability for payments under the guarantee
        will be satisfied and discharged by the surrender of the vessel
        and all interest in the vessel to the Government in the
        condition described in paragraph (2).

        (2) Surrender of vessel. - 
          (A) In general. - On surrender, the vessel must be - 
            (i) free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except the
          security interest conveyed to the Administrator under this
          chapter;
            (ii) in class; and
            (iii) in as good order and condition (ordinary wear and
          tear excepted) as when acquired by the obligor.

          (B) Covering deficiencies by insurance. - To the extent
        covered by insurance, a deficiency related to a requirement in
        subparagraph (A) may be satisfied by assignment of the
        obligor's insurance claims to the Government.

      (c) Other Provisions To Protect Security Interests. - An
    obligation guaranteed under this chapter and any related agreement
    must contain other provisions for the protection of the security
    interests of the Government (including acceleration, assumption,
    and subrogation provisions and the issuance of notes by the obligor
    to the Secretary or Administrator), liens and releases of liens,
    payment of taxes, and other matters that the Secretary or
    Administrator may prescribe.

      During review of this bill, the American Bureau of Shipping,
    through counsel, explained that it disagrees with an existing
    interpretation by the Maritime Administration of language restated
    in subsection (a)(4)(A) of this section, and requested the
    Committee to clarify that this codification should not be construed
    as a ratification of that regulatory interpretation. The Committee
    therefore states that this codification should not be construed as
    an expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning any such
    administrative interpretation.
      In subsection (a)(3), the words "subject to the provisions of
    paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this section" are omitted as
    unnecessary.
      In subsection (a)(4)(B), the words "well equipped, in good
    repair, and in every respect seaworthy and fit for service" are
    substituted for "tight, stanch, strong, and well and sufficiently
    tackled, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every respect
    seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, and in all
    respects fit for service" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (b)(1), the reference to section 503 of the

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary or Administrator may guarantee an
    obligation under this chapter only if the obligor conveys or agrees
    to convey to the Secretary or Administrator a security interest the
    Secretary or Administrator considers necessary to protect the
    interest of the United States Government.
      (b) Multiple Vessels and Types of Security. - The security
    interest may relate to more than one vessel and may consist of more
    than one type of security. If the security interest relates to more
    than one vessel, the obligation may have the latest maturity date
    allowable under section 53710(a)(3) of this title for any of the
    vessels used as security for the guarantee. However, the Secretary
    or Administrator may require such payments of principal prior to
    maturity, with respect to all related obligations, as the Secretary
    or Administrator considers necessary to maintain adequate security
    for the guarantee.

    Sec. 53712. Monitoring financial condition and operations of
      obligor

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary or Administrator shall monitor
    the financial condition and operations of the obligor on a regular
    basis during the term of the guarantee. The Secretary or
    Administrator shall document the results of the monitoring on an
    annual or quarterly basis depending on the condition of the
    obligor. If the Secretary or Administrator determines that the
    financial condition of the obligor warrants additional protections
    to the Secretary or Administrator, the Secretary or Administrator
    shall take appropriate action under subsection (b). If the
    Secretary or Administrator determines that the financial condition
    of the obligor jeopardizes its continued ability to perform its
    responsibilities in connection with the guarantee of an obligation
    by the Secretary or Administrator, the Secretary or Administrator
    shall make an immediate determination whether default should take
    place and whether further measures described in subsection (b)
    should be taken to protect the interests of the Secretary or
    Administrator while ensuring that program objectives are met.
      (b) Contract Provisions To Protect Secretary or Administrator. -
    The Secretary or Administrator shall include provisions in a loan
    agreement with an obligor that provides additional authority to the
    Secretary or Administrator to take action to limit potential losses
    in connection with a defaulted loan or a loan that is in jeopardy
    due to the deteriorating financial condition of the obligor. If the
    Secretary or Administrator has waived a requirement under section
    53707(d) of this title, the loan agreement shall include
    requirements for additional payments, collateral, or equity
    contributions to meet the waived requirement upon the occurrence of
    verifiable conditions indicating that the obligor's financial
    condition enables the obligor to meet the waived requirement.

    Sec. 53714. Guarantee fees

-STATUTE-
      (a) Regulations. - Subject to this section, the Secretary or
    Administrator shall prescribe regulations to assess a fee for
    guaranteeing an obligation under this chapter.
      (b) Computation of Fee. - 
        (1) In general. - The amount of the fee for a guarantee under
      this chapter shall be equal to the sum of the amounts determined
      under paragraph (2) for the years in which the guarantee is in
      effect.
        (2) Present value for each year. - The amount referred to in
      paragraph (1) for a year in which the guarantee is in effect is
      the present value of the amount calculated under paragraph (3).
      To determine the present value, the Secretary or Administrator
      shall apply a discount rate determined by the Secretary of the
      Treasury, considering current market yields on outstanding
      obligations of the United States Government having periods to
      maturity comparable to the period to maturity for the guaranteed
      obligation.
        (3) Calculation of amount. - The amount referred to in
      paragraph (2) shall be calculated by multiplying - 
          (A) the estimated average unpaid principal amount of the
        obligation that will be outstanding during the year (excluding
        the average amount, other than interest, on deposit during the
        year in an escrow fund under section 53715 of this title); by
          (B) the fee rate set under paragraph (4).

        (4) Setting fee rates. - To set the fee rate referred to in
      paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary or Administrator shall establish
      a formula that - 
          (A) takes into account the security provided for the
        guaranteed obligation; and
          (B) is a sliding scale based on the creditworthiness of the
        obligor, using - 
            (i) the lowest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the
          most creditworthy obligors; and
            (ii) the highest allowable rate under paragraph (5) for the
          least creditworthy obligors.

        (5) Permissible range of rates. - The fee rate set under
      paragraph (4) shall be - 
          (A) for a delivered vessel or equipment, at least 0.5 percent
        and not more than 1 percent; and
          (B) for a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or
        reconditioned or equipment to be delivered, at least 0.25
        percent and not more than 0.5 percent.

      (c) When Fee Collected. - A fee for the guarantee of an
    obligation under this chapter shall be collected not later than the
    date on which an amount is first paid on the obligation.
      (d) Financing the Fee. - A fee paid under this section is
    eligible to be financed under this chapter and shall be included in
    the actual cost of the obligation guaranteed.
      (e) Not Refundable. - A fee paid under this section is not
    refundable. However, an obligor shall receive credit for the amount
    paid for the remaining term of the obligation if the obligation is
    refinanced and guaranteed under this chapter after the refinancing.

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53715. Escrow fund

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - If the proceeds of an obligation guaranteed
    under this chapter are to be used to finance the construction,
    reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel that will serve as
    security for a guarantee under this chapter, the Secretary or
    Administrator may accept and hold in escrow, under an escrow
    agreement with the obligor, a portion of the proceeds of all
    obligations guaranteed under this chapter whose proceeds are to be
    so used which is equal to - 
        (1) the excess of - 
          (A) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds
        are to be so used; over
          (B) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under
        section 53709(b) of this title, of the amount paid by or for
        the account of the obligor for the construction,
        reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel; plus

        (2) any interest the Secretary or Administrator may require on
      the amount described in paragraph (1).

      (b) Security Involving Both Uncompleted and Delivered Vessels. -
    If the security for the guarantee of an obligation relates both to
    a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned and to
    a delivered vessel, the principal amount of the obligation shall be
    prorated for purposes of subsection (a) under regulations
    prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator.
      (c) Disbursement Before Termination of Agreement. - 
        (1) Purposes. - The Secretary or Administrator shall disburse
      amounts in the escrow fund, as specified in the escrow agreement,
      to - 
          (A) pay amounts the obligor is obligated to pay for - 
            (i) the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of
          a vessel used as security for the guarantee; and
            (ii) interest on the obligations;

          (B) redeem the obligations under a refinancing guaranteed
        under this chapter; and
          (C) pay any excess interest deposits to the obligor at times
        provided for in the escrow agreement.

        (2) Manner of payment. - If a payment becomes due under the
      guarantee before the termination of the escrow agreement, the
      amount in the escrow fund at the time the payment becomes due,
      including realized income not yet paid to the obligor, shall be
      paid into the appropriate account under section 53717 of this
      title. The amount shall be credited against amounts due or to
      become due from the obligor to the Secretary or Administrator on
      the guaranteed obligations or, to the extent not so required, be
      paid to the obligor.

      (d) Payments Required Before Disbursement. - 
        (1) In general. - No disbursement shall be made under
      subsection (c) to any person until the total amount paid by or
      for the account of the obligor from sources other than the
      proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5
      percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this
      title, of the aggregate actual cost of the vessel, as previously
      approved by the Secretary or Administrator. If the aggregate
      actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or
      Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the
      first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no
      further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until
      the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from
      sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least
      25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as
      determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate
      actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the
      Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in
      actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that
      such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and
      conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.
        (2) Documented proof of progress requirement. - The Secretary
      or Administrator shall, by regulation, establish a transparent,
      independent, and risk-based process for verifying and documenting
      the progress of projects under construction before disbursing
      guaranteed loan funds. At a minimum, the process shall require
      documented proof of progress in connection with the construction,
      reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels before
      disbursements are made from the escrow fund. The Secretary or
      Administrator may require that the obligor provide a certificate
      from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress
      in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken
      place.

      (e) Disbursement on Termination of Agreement. - 
        (1) In general. - If a payment has not become due under the
      guarantee before the termination of the escrow agreement, the
      balance of the escrow fund at the time of termination shall be
      disbursed to - 
          (A) prepay the excess of - 
            (i) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds
          are to be used to finance the construction, reconstruction,
          or reconditioning of the vessel used or to be used as
          security for the guarantee; over
            (ii) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable
          under section 53709(b) of this title, of the actual cost of
          the vessel to the extent paid; and

          (B) pay interest on that prepaid amount of principal.

        (2) Remaining balance. - Any remaining balance of the escrow
      fund shall be paid to the obligor.

      (f) Investment. - The Secretary or Administrator may invest and
    reinvest any part of an escrow fund in obligations of the United
    States Government with maturities such that the escrow fund will be
    available as required for purposes of the escrow agreement.
    Investment income shall be paid to the obligor when received.
      (g) Terms To Protect Government. - The escrow agreement shall
    contain other terms the Secretary or Administrator considers
    necessary to protect fully the interests of the Government.

    Sec. 53721. Rights of obligee

-STATUTE-
      (a) Demands by Obligees. - Except as provided in subsection (c),
    if an obligor has continued in default for 30 days in the payment
    of principal or interest on an obligation guaranteed under this
    chapter, the obligee or the obligee's agent may demand that the
    Secretary or Administrator pay the unpaid principal amount of the
    obligation and the unpaid interest on the obligation to the date of
    payment. The demand must be made within the earlier of - 
        (1) a period that may be specified in the guarantee or a
      related agreement; or
        (2) 90 days from the date of the default.

      (b) Payments by Secretary or Administrator. - 
        (1) In general. - If a demand is made under subsection (a), the
      Secretary or Administrator shall pay to the obligee or the
      obligee's agent the unpaid principal amount of the obligation and
      the unpaid interest on the obligation to the date of payment.
      Payment shall be made within the earlier of - 
          (A) a period that may be specified in the guarantee or a
        related agreement; or
          (B) 30 days from the date of the demand.

        (2) If no existing default. - The Secretary or Administrator is
      not required to make payment under this subsection if, within the
      appropriate period under paragraph (1), the Secretary or
      Administrator finds that the obligor was not in default or that
      the default was remedied before the demand.

      (c) Assumption of Rights and Obligations Before Demand. - An
    obligee or the obligee's agent may not demand payment under this
    section if the Secretary or Administrator, before the demand and on
    terms that may be provided in the obligation or a related
    agreement, has assumed the obligor's rights and duties under the
    obligation and any related agreement and made any payment in
    default. However, the guarantee of the obligation remains in effect
    after the Secretary's or Administrator's assumption.

    provided in the obligation or agreement, may - 
        (1) assume the obligor's rights and duties under the obligation

      (b) Demands by Obligees. - 
        (1) Demand. - If the Secretary or Administrator proceeds under

      that the Secretary or Administrator pay the unpaid principal
      amount of the obligation and the unpaid interest on the
      obligation. The demand must be made within the earlier of -

        related agreement; or
          (B) 60 days from the date of the Secretary's or
        Administrator's notice.

      disposition of assets associated with the obligation, including
      prompt referral to the Attorney General for collection as
      appropriate;
        (2) minimizes the amount of any loss realized in the resolution

      obligations

-STATUTE-
      (a) Cash Payment. - Amounts required to be paid by the Secretary
    or Administrator under section 53721 or 53722 of this title shall
    be paid in cash.
      (b) Issuance of Obligations. - If amounts in the appropriate
    account under section 53717 of this title are not sufficient to
    make a payment required under section 53721 or 53722 of this title,
    the Secretary or Administrator may issue obligations to the
    Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary or Administrator, with the
    approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe the
    form, denomination, maturity, and other terms (except the interest
    rate) of the obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall set
    the interest rate for the obligations, considering the current
    average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the
    United States Government of comparable maturities during the month
    before the obligations are issued.
      (c) Purchase of Obligations. - The Secretary of the Treasury
    shall purchase the obligations issued under this section. To
    purchase the obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury may use as
    a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of securities
    issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which
    securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include
    the purchase of obligations under this subsection. The Secretary of
    the Treasury may sell obligations purchased under this section. A
    redemption, purchase, or sale of the obligations by the Secretary
    of the Treasury is a public debt transaction of the Government.
      (d) Deposits and Redemptions. - The Secretary or Administrator
    shall deposit amounts borrowed under this section in the
    appropriate account under section 53717 of this title and make
    redemptions of the obligations from that account.

    guarantee or commitment to guarantee under subchapter I of this
    chapter.
      (c) Economic Soundness. - The required determination of economic
    soundness under section 53708 of this title applies to a guarantee

    of Energy, in consultation with the Administrator, certifies to the
    Administrator that, for the facility or plantship for which the
    guarantee or commitment to guarantee is sought, there is sufficient
    guarantee of performance and payment to lower the risk to the
    United States Government to a reasonable level. In deciding whether
    to issue such a certification, the Secretary of Energy shall
    consider - 
        (1) the successful demonstration of the technology to be used
      in the facility at a scale sufficient to establish the likelihood
      of technical and economic viability in the proposed market; and
        (2) the need of the United States to develop new and renewable
      sources of energy and the benefits to be realized from the
      construction and successful operation of the facility or
      plantship.

      (e) Amount of Obligation. - The total principal amount of an
    obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5
    percent of -

      or plantship; or
        (2) if the facility or plantship is supported with appropriated
      Federal funds, the total principal amount of that portion of the
      actual cost or depreciated actual cost for which the obligor is
      obligated to secure financing under the agreement between the
      obligor and the Department of Energy or other Federal agency.

      (f) OTEC Demonstration Fund. - 
        (1) In general. - There is a special subaccount, known as the
      OTEC Demonstration Fund, in the account established under section
      53717(b)(1) of this title.
        (2) Use and operation. - The OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be
      used for obligation guarantees authorized under this section that
      do not qualify under subchapter I of this chapter. Except as
      otherwise provided in this section, the OTEC Demonstration Fund
      shall be operated in the same manner as the parent account.
      However - 
          (A) amounts received by the Administrator under subchapter I
        of this chapter related to guarantees or commitments to
        guarantee made under this section shall be deposited only in
        the OTEC Demonstration Fund; and
          (B) when obligations issued by the Administrator under
        section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC Demonstration
        Fund are outstanding, any amount received by the Administrator
        under subchapter I of this chapter related to ocean thermal
        energy conversion facilities or plantships shall be deposited
        in the OTEC Demonstration Fund.

        (3) Transfers. - Assets in the OTEC Demonstration Fund may be
      transferred to the parent account when and to the extent the
      balance in the OTEC Demonstration Fund exceeds the total
      guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section
      then outstanding, plus obligations issued by the Administrator
      under section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC
      Demonstration Fund.
        (4) Liability. - The parent account is not liable for a
      guarantee or commitment to guarantee made under this section.
        (5) Maximum unpaid principal amount. - The total unpaid
      principal amount of the obligations guaranteed with the backing
      of the OTEC Demonstration Fund and outstanding at any one time
      may not exceed $1,650,000,000.

      (g) Issuance and Payment of Obligations. - Section 53723 of this
    title applies to the OTEC Demonstration Fund. However, obligations
    issued by the Administrator under that section related to the OTEC
    Demonstration Fund shall be payable only from proceeds realized by
    the OTEC Demonstration Fund.
      (h) Taxation of Interest. - Interest on an obligation guaranteed
    under this section shall be included in gross income under chapter
    1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1).

      In subsection (a), the words "upon such terms as he shall
    prescribe" are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of

    obsolete.
      In subsection (f)(1), the words "account established under

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53732. Eligible export vessels

-STATUTE-
      (a) Applicable Terms. - The Administrator may guarantee an
    obligation for an eligible export vessel in accordance with - 
        (1) the terms applicable under this chapter for vessels
      documented under the laws of the United States; or
        (2) other terms the Administrator determines are more favorable
      than those terms and compatible with export credit terms offered
      by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign
      shipyards.

      (b) Interagency Council. - 
        (1) Establishment. - There is an interagency council to carry
      out this section.
        (2) Composition. - The council is composed of the following
      individuals or their designees:
          (A) The Administrator, who is the chairman of the council.
          (B) The Secretary of the Treasury.
          (C) The Secretary of State.
          (D) The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.
          (E) The United States Trade Representative.
          (F) The President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of
        the United States.

        (3) Functions. - The council shall - 
          (A) obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees,
        direct and indirect subsidies, and other favorable treatment of
        shipyards provided by foreign governments to shipyards in
        competition with United States shipyards;
          (B) consult regularly with United States shipbuilders to
        obtain the essential information about international
        shipbuilding competition on which to set terms for loan
        guarantees under subsection (a)(2); and
          (C) provide guidance to the Administrator in establishing
        terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2).

        (4) Annual report. - Not later than January 31 of each year,
      the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on activities
      of the Administrator under this section during the preceding
      year. The report shall include - 
          (A) documentation of sources of information about assistance
        by governments of other countries to shipyards in those
        countries; and
          (B) a summary of recommendations made to the Administrator
        during the preceding year about applications submitted to the
        Administrator during that year for loan guarantees to construct
        eligible export vessels.

      (c) Required Findings. - 
        (1) Benefit to shipbuilding industry. - The Administrator may
      not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for
      an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator finds that the
      construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel
      will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to
      commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that
      would be essential in time of war or national emergency.
        (2) Priority of documented vessels. - The Administrator may not
      make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible
      export vessel unless the Administrator determines that making the
      commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound
      application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a
      vessel documented under the laws of the United States and
      operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United
      States. The Administrator has sole discretion in making the
      determination. In making the determination, the Administrator
      shall consider - 
          (A) the status and economic soundness of pending applications
        for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented
        under the laws of the United States that are operating or will
        be operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United
        States; and
          (B) the amount of guarantee authority available.

      (d) Restriction on Transfer of Vessel. - The Administrator may
    not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for
    an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees
    with the Administrator that the vessel will not be transferred to a
    country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose
    interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.
      (e) Review by Secretary of Defense. - 
        (1) Notification. - The Administrator shall promptly notify the
      Secretary of Defense of the receipt of an application for a loan
      guarantee for an eligible export vessel.
        (2) Disapproval. - The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days
      after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on
      an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that
      may harm the national security interests of the United States.
      The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a guarantee solely
      because of the type of vessel to be constructed.
        (3) Delegation. - The authority of the Secretary of Defense to
      disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated
      only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed
      by the President by and with the advice and consent of the
      Senate.
        (4) Prohibition. - The Administrator may not make a loan
      guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this
      subsection.

      (f) Expiration of Authority. - The Administrator may not issue a
    commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel
    under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment
    may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after
    November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.

      In subsection (f), the source provides that the authority to
    issue commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export
    vessels expires after the later of three events. The first event,
    which is "(A) the 5th anniversary of the date on which the
    Secretary publishes final regulations setting forth the application
    procedures for the issuance of commitments to guarantee obligations
    for eligible export vessels", is omitted because the final
    regulations were published on September 16, 1994. See 59 Fed. Reg.
    47548. The second event, which is "(B) the last day of any 5-year
    period in which funding and guarantee authority for obligations for
    eligible export vessels have been continuously available", is
    omitted because that date was November 11, 1998, five years after
    enactment of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994
    (Pub. L. 103-139, Nov. 11, 1993, 107 Stat. 1418).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53734. Replacement of vessels because of changes in operating
      standards

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - Notwithstanding any other provision of
    this chapter, the Secretary or Administrator, on terms the
    Secretary or Administrator may prescribe, may guarantee or make a
    commitment to guarantee the payment of the principal of and
    interest on an obligation that aids in financing or refinancing
    (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously
    made for) a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a
    vessel if - 
        (1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in
      coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;
        (2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace
      a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change
      required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels,
      and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not
      otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the
      trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;
        (3) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes
      in vessels of the type and class that will be constructed or
      reconstructed under this section and agrees to employ vessels
      constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements
      only for vessels made obsolete by the change in operating
      standards;
        (4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or
      reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo
      carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;
        (5) the Secretary or Administrator has not determined that the
      market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish
      so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;
        (6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life
      of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and
        (7) the Secretary or Administrator has considered the criteria
      specified in section 53708(a)(3)-(5) of this title.

      (b) Term and Amount of Obligation. - 
        (1) Term. - The term of an obligation guaranteed under this
      section may not exceed 25 years.
        (2) Amount. - The amount of an obligation guaranteed under this
      section may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or
      depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or
      reconstruction of the vessel. The Secretary or Administrator may
      not establish a percentage under this paragraph that is to be
      applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee
      made under this section.

      (c) Applicability of Other Provisions. - A guarantee or
    commitment to guarantee under this section is also subject to
    sections 53701, 53702(a), 53704, 53705, 53707(a), 53708(d) and (e),
    53709(a), 53710(a)(1), (2), and (4) and (c), 53711(a), 53713,
    53714, 53717, and 53721-53725 of this title.
      (d) Security Against Default. - The Secretary or Administrator
    shall require by regulation that an applicant under this section
    provide adequate security against default.
      (e) Guarantee Fees. - The Secretary or Administrator may
    establish a fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this
    section that is in addition to the fee established under section
    53714 of this title. The fee may be - 
        (1) an annual fee of not more than an additional 1 percent
      added to the fee established under section 53714 of this title;
      or
        (2) a fee based on the amount of the obligation versus the
      percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels
      constructed or reconstructed under this section.

      In subsection (b)(2), the words "by rule, regulation, or

    Sec. 53735. Fisheries financing and capacity reduction

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "program" means a
    fishing capacity reduction program established under section 312 of
    the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16
    U.S.C. 1861a).
      (b) Guarantee Authority. - The Secretary may guarantee the
    repayment of debt obligations issued by entities under this
    section. Debt obligations to be guaranteed may be issued by any
    entity that has been approved by the Secretary and has agreed with
    the Secretary to conditions the Secretary considers necessary for
    this section to achieve the objective of the program and to protect
    the interest of the United States.
      (c) Requirements of Obligations. - A debt obligation guaranteed
    under this section shall - 
        (1) be treated in the same manner and to the same extent as
      other obligations guaranteed under this chapter, except with
      respect to provisions of this chapter that by their nature cannot
      be applied to obligations guaranteed under this section;
        (2) have the fishing fees established under the program paid
      into a separate subaccount of the fishing capacity reduction fund
      established under this section;
        (3) not exceed $100,000,000 in an unpaid principal amount
      outstanding at any one time for a program;
        (4) have such maturity (not to exceed 20 years), take such
      form, and contain such conditions as the Secretary determines
      necessary for the program to which they relate;
        (5) have as the exclusive source of repayment (subject to the
      second sentence of subsection (d)(2)) and as the exclusive
      payment security, the fishing fees established under the program;
      and
        (6) at the discretion of the Secretary be issued in the public
      market or sold to the Federal Financing Bank.

      (d) Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund. - 
        (1) In general. - There is a separate account in the Treasury,
      known as the Fishing Capacity Reduction Fund. Within the Fund, at
      least one subaccount shall be established for each program into
      which shall be paid all fishing fees established under the
      program and other amounts authorized for the program.
        (2) Availability of amounts. - Amounts in the Fund shall be
      available, without appropriation or fiscal year limitation, to
      the Secretary to pay the cost of the program, including payments
      to financial institutions to pay debt obligations incurred by
      entities under this section. Funds available for this purpose
      from other amounts available for the program may also be used to
      pay those debt obligations.
        (3) Investment. - Amounts in the Fund that are not currently
      needed for the purpose of this section shall be kept on deposit
      or invested in obligations of the United States Government.

      (e) Regulations. - The Secretary shall prescribe regulations the
    Secretary considers necessary to carry out this section.

      In paragraph (1)(A), the words "a documented vessel with a
    registry or coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of this title"
    are substituted for "any vessel registered, enrolled, or licensed
    under the laws of the United States" because of 46 U.S.C. 12101(b).
      In paragraph (1)(B). the words "or any department or agency
    thereof" are omitted as surplus.
      In paragraph (1)(C), the word "fisheries" is substituted for
    "fishing trade or industry" because of the definition of
    "fisheries" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

      of a vessel insurable under this section or of the owner or
      charterer of such a vessel, of a nature customarily covered by
      insurance.

      (b) Considerations for Foreign Vessels. - In determining whether
    to provide insurance or reinsurance for a foreign vessel, the
    Secretary shall consider the characteristics, employment, and
    general management of the vessel by the owner or charterer.
      (c) Non-War Risks. - Insurance of a risk under subsection (a)(5)-
    (7), insofar as it involves a liability related to an individual
    on the vessel, may include risks other than war risks to the extent
    the Secretary considers advisable.

    Sec. 53906. Hull insurance valuation

-STATUTE-
      (a) Stated Valuation. - The valuation in a hull insurance policy
    for actual or constructive total loss of the insured vessel shall
    be a stated valuation determined by the Secretary of
    Transportation. The stated valuation - 
        (1) shall exclude national defense features paid for by the
      United States Government; and
        (2) may not exceed the amount that would be payable if the
      ownership of the vessel had been requisitioned under chapter 563
      of this title at the time the insurance attached under the
      policy.

      (b) Rejecting Stated Valuation. - Within 60 days after the
    insurance attaches under a policy referred to in subsection (a) or
    within 60 days after the Secretary determines the valuation,
    whichever is later, the insured may reject the valuation and pay,
    at the rate provided in the policy, premiums based on the asserted
    valuation the insured specifies at the time of rejection. However,
    the asserted valuation is not binding on the Government in any
    subsequent action on the policy.
      (c) Amount of Claim. - If a vessel is actually or constructively
    totally lost and the insured under a policy referred to in
    subsection (a) has not rejected the stated valuation determined by
    the Secretary, the amount of a claim adjusted, compromised,
    settled, adjudged, or paid may not exceed the stated valuation.
    However, if the insured has rejected the valuation, the insured - 
        (1) shall be paid, as a tentative advance only, 75 percent of
      the stated valuation; and
        (2) may bring a civil action against the United States in a
      court having jurisdiction of the claim to recover a valuation
      equal to the just compensation the court determines would have
      been payable if the ownership of the vessel had been
      requisitioned under chapter 563 of this title at the time the
      insurance attached under the policy.

      (d) Adjusting Premiums. - If a court makes a determination as
    provided under subsection (c)(2), premiums paid under the policy
    shall be adjusted based on the court's determination and the rates
    provided for in the policy.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - To the extent the Secretary of Transportation
    is authorized to provide insurance under this chapter, the
    Secretary may provide reinsurance to a company authorized to do
    insurance business in a State of the United States. The Secretary
    may obtain reinsurance from such a company for any insurance
    provided by the Secretary under this chapter.
      (b) Rates. - The Secretary may not provide reinsurance at rates
    less than, nor obtain reinsurance at rates more than, the rates
    established by the Secretary on the same or similar risks or the
    rates charged by the insurance company for the insurance reinsured,
    whichever is more advantageous to the Secretary. However, the
    Secretary may provide an allowance to the insurance company for the
    costs of services and facilities the company provides, in an amount
    the Secretary considers reasonable according to good business
    practice. The allowance to the company may not include any amount
    for soliciting or stimulating insurance business.

      In subsection (c), the reference to the Fiscal Service
    [previously Division of Disbursement] in the Treasury Department is
    omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (d), the amendment by section 3502(b) of Public Law
    108-375, which struck the third sentence in 46 App. U.S.C. 1288 and
    inserted new material, was executed as if it were intended to
    strike the fourth sentence instead, to reflect probably [sic]
    intent.
      The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1288(b) is omitted as unnecessary
    because enactment of a law authorizing certain governmental
    functions is itself an authorization of appropriations to carry out
    those functions. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1288a is omitted as
    executed and impliedly repealed by 46 App. U.S.C. 1119.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 53911. Civil actions for losses

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - If there is a disagreement about a loss insured
    under this chapter, a civil action in admiralty may be brought
    against the United States in the district court of the United
    States for the district in which the plaintiff or the plaintiff's
    agent resides. If the plaintiff has no residence in the United
    States, the action may be brought in the United States District
    Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for any
    district in which the Attorney General agrees to accept service.
    Any person who may have an interest in the insurance may be made a
    party, either initially or on the motion of either party.
      (b) Exclusive Remedy. - A civil action against the United States
    under this section is exclusive of any other action by reason of
    the same subject matter against an officer, employee, or agent
    employed or retained by the Government under this chapter.
      (c) Procedure. - A civil action under this section shall be heard
    and determined under chapter 309 of this title.
      (d) Tolling of Limitations Period. - If a claim is filed with the
    Secretary of Transportation, the running of the limitations period
    for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies
    the claim, and for 60 days thereafter. The Secretary is deemed to
    have denied the claim if the Secretary does not act on the claim
    within 6 months after the claim is filed, unless the Secretary for
    good cause shown agrees with the claimant on a different period for
    the Secretary to act on the claim.
      (e) Interpleader. - If the Secretary acknowledges the
    indebtedness of the Government under the insurance and there is a
    dispute about the persons entitled to receive payment, the
    Government may bring a civil action interpleading those persons.
    The action shall be brought in the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district
    in which any of those persons resides. A person not residing or
    found in the district may be made a party by service in any
    reasonable manner the court directs. If the court is satisfied that
    unknown persons might make a claim under the insurance, the court
    may direct service on those unknown persons by publication in the
    Federal Register. Judgment after service by publication in the
    Federal Register discharges the Government from further liability
    to all persons.

        competitive operations, and quality ship construction, repair,
        and reconfiguration; and

      In subsection (a), the words "apply to the United States,
    including" are substituted for "extend to" for clarity. The words
    "From and after February 1, 1922" and "not covered thereby on June
    5, 1920" are omitted as obsolete. The requirement to establish
    adequate steamship service to the island Territories and
    possessions is omitted as obsolete.
      Subsection (b)(2) is based on section 503(b) of the Covenant To
    Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in
    Political Union With the United States of America (48 U.S.C. 1801
    note).
      Subsection (b)(3) is based on Proc. No. 3215, Dec. 12, 1957, 72
    Stat. c19, which provided that the President, "under and by virtue
    of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 21 of the
    Merchant Marine Act, 1920 [46 App. U.S.C. 877], do hereby declare
    and proclaim that the period for the establishment of an adequate
    shipping service for Canton Island is extended until further notice
    by proclamation of the President, and that the extension of the
    coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island is deferred
    until it is declared by proclamation of the President that such
    adequate shipping service has been established".
      In subsection (b)(4), the words "and fix a date for the going
    into effect of same" are omitted as surplus.
      The provisos of 46 App. U.S.C. 877 relating to the Philippine
    Islands are omitted as obsolete because of the independence of the
    Philippine Islands. See Proc. No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 60 Stat. 1352
    (22 U.S.C. 1394 note).

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "merchandise"
    includes - 
        (1) merchandise owned by the United States Government, a State,
      or a subdivision of a State; and
        (2) valueless material.

      (b) Requirements. - Except as otherwise provided in this chapter
    or chapter 121 of this title, a vessel may not provide any part of
    the transportation of merchandise by water, or by land and water,
    between points in the United States to which the coastwise laws
    apply, either directly or via a foreign port, unless the vessel - 
        (1) is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for
      purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and
        (2) has been issued a certificate of documentation with a
      coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 or is exempt from

      certificate and endorsement.

      (c) Penalty. - Merchandise transported in violation of subsection
    (b) is liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government.

      In subsection (a)(1), the words "(as defined in section 2101 of
    the [sic] title 46)" are omitted because the definition of "State"
    is being moved to chapter 1 and will apply to the entire title.
      In subsection (b), the words "may not provide any part of the
    transportation of" are substituted for "No . . . shall be
    transported" and "or for any part of the transportation" because of
    the reorganization of the language. The words "including Districts,
    Territories, and possessions thereof" are omitted because of the
    definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.
    The words "to which the coastwise laws apply" are substituted for
    "embraced within the coastwise laws" for consistency with section
    55101. The words "is wholly owned by citizens of the United States
    for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade" are substituted
    for "owned by persons who are citizens of the United States", and
    the words "has been issued a certificate of documentation with a
    coastwise endorsement under chapter 121" are substituted for
    "documented under the laws of the United States", for clarity and
    consistency in the revised title. The words "or is exempt from
    documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a
    certificate and endorsement" are added for consistency with section
    12102 as revised by the bill. The requirement that the vessel be
    built in the United States is omitted from this section for
    consistency with the requirements for a coastwise endorsement,
    which also require that the vessel be built in the United States
    except in certain circumstances. The words "or vessels to which the
    privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade is extended by section
    808 of this Appendix or section 22 of this Act" are omitted because
    the relevant portion of section 808, and section 22, have been
    repealed.
      In subsection (c), the words "any person" are substituted for
    "any consignor, seller, owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other
    person or persons" to eliminate unnecessary words.

    Sec. 55105. Transportation of hazardous waste

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The transportation of hazardous waste, as
    defined in section 1004(5) of the Resource Conservation and
    Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6903(5)), from a point in the
    United States to sea for incineration is deemed to be
    transportation of merchandise under section 55102 of this title.
      (b) Nonapplication to Certain Foreign Vessels. - 
        (1) In general. - Subsection (a) does not apply to
      transportation performed by a foreign ocean incineration vessel
      owned by or under construction on May 1, 1982, for a corporation
      wholly owned by citizens of the United States under section
      50501(a)-(c) of this title.
        (2) Standards for incineration equipment. - Incineration
      equipment on a vessel described in paragraph (1) must meet
      standards of the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection
      Agency.
        (3) Inspection. - A vessel described in paragraph (1) shall be
      inspected by the Coast Guard, regardless of whether inspected by
      the nation in which it is registered. The inspection shall be the
      same as would be required of a vessel of the United States,
      including drydock inspection and internal examination of tanks
      and void spaces. The inspection may be made concurrently with an
      inspection by that nation or within one year after the initial
      issuance or next scheduled issuance of the Safety of Life at Sea
      Safety Construction Certificate. In making the inspection, the
      Coast Guard shall refer to the condition of the hull and
      superstructure established by the initial foreign certification
      as the basis for evaluating the current condition of the hull and
      superstructure. The Coast Guard shall allow the substitution of
      fittings, material, apparatus, equipment, and appliances
      different from those required for vessels of the United States if
      satisfied they are equivalent and at least as effective as those
      required for vessels of the United States. A satisfactory
      inspection under this paragraph shall be certified in writing by
      the Secretary of Homeland Security.

      (c) Effective Date. - Subsection (a) is not effective until an
    appropriate vessel has been built and documented under chapter 121
    of this title.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - On terms and conditions the Secretary of
    Homeland Security may prescribe by regulation, the Secretary may
    suspend the application of section 55102 of this title to the
    transportation of merchandise that is transferred, when moving in
    the foreign trade of the United States, from a barge certified by
    the owner or operator as designed specifically for carriage on a
    vessel and carried regularly on a vessel in foreign trade, to
    another such barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator.
    However, this subsection does not apply to transportation between
    the continental United States and noncontiguous States,
    territories, or possessions to which the coastwise laws apply.
      (b) Reciprocity Requirement for Foreign Vessels. - This section
    applies to a vessel of foreign registry only if the Secretary of
    Homeland Security finds, based on information from the Secretary of
    State, that the government of the nation of registry extends
    reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 55108. Platform jackets

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definitions. - In this section:
        (1) Coastwise qualified vessel. - The term "coastwise qualified
      vessel" means a vessel that has been issued a certificate of
      documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of
      this title.
        (2) Platform jacket. - The term "platform jacket" refers to a
      single physical component and includes any type of offshore
      exploration, development, or production structure or component
      thereof, including - 
          (A) platform jackets;
          (B) tension leg or SPAR platform superstructures (including
        the deck, drilling rig and support utilities, and supporting
        structure);
          (C) hull (including vertical legs and connecting pontoons or
        vertical cylinder);
          (D) tower and base sections of a platform jacket;
          (E) jacket structures; and
          (F) deck modules (known as "topsides").

      (b) Authorized Transportation. - Section 55102 of this title does
    not apply to the transportation of a platform jacket in or on a non-
    coastwise qualified launch barge between two points in the United
    States, at one of which there is an installation or other device
    within the meaning of section 4(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf
    Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1333(a)), if - 
        (1) the launch barge was built before December 31, 2000, and
      has a launch capacity of at least 12,000 long tons; and
        (2) the Secretary of Transportation makes a determination, in
      accordance with procedures established under subsection (c), that
      a suitable coastwise qualified vessel is not available for use in
      the transportation and, if needed, launch or installation of a
      platform jacket.

      (c) Procedures To Maximize Use of Coastwise Qualified Vessels. -
    The Secretary of Transportation shall adopt procedures implementing
    this section that are reasonably designed to provide timely
    information so as to maximize the use of coastwise qualified
    vessels. The procedures shall, among other things, establish that
    for purposes of this section, a coastwise qualified vessel shall be
    deemed to be not available only if - 
        (1) on application by an owner or operator for the use of a non-
      coastwise qualified launch barge for transportation of a
      platform jacket under this section (which application shall
      include all relevant information, including engineering details
      and timing requirements), the Secretary promptly publishes a
      notice in the Federal Register - 
          (A) describing the project and the platform jacket involved;
          (B) advising that all relevant information reasonably needed
        to assess the transportation requirements for the platform
        jacket will be made available to interested parties on request;
        and
          (C) requesting that information on the availability of
        coastwise qualified vessels be submitted within 30 days after
        publication of that notice; and

        (2)(A) no information is submitted to the Secretary within that
      30 day period; or
        (B) the owner or operator of a coastwise qualified vessel
      submits information to the Secretary asserting that the owner or
      operator has a suitable coastwise qualified vessel available for
      the transportation, but the Secretary determines, within 90 days
      after the notice is first published, that the coastwise qualified
      vessel is not suitable or reasonably available for the
      transportation.

    may engage in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States
    only if - 
        (1) the vessel is wholly owned by citizens of the United States
      for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade;
        (2) the charterer, if any, is a citizen of the United States
      for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and
        (3) the vessel has been issued a certificate of documentation
      with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of this title or
      is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for
      such a certificate and endorsement.

      Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for "(1) the vessel meets the
    requirements of section 883 of this Appendix and sections 802 and
    803 of this Appendix for engaging in the coastwise trade" for
    consistency with other sections of the revised title and to
    eliminate unnecessary words. Section 883 requires (among other
    things) that the vessel be owned by citizens of the United States,
    and section 802 contains the requirements for certain entities to
    qualify as citizens. Those requirements are restated in section
    50501 which applies to this section. Section 883 also requires that
    the vessel be built in and documented under the laws of the United
    States. Those latter two requirements are covered by subsection
    (a)(3). Note that the build requirement is a requirement for a
    coastwise endorsement.
      In subsection (a)(3), the words "or is exempt from documentation
    but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and
    endorsement" are added for consistency with section 12102 as

      [H.R. Rep. No. 109-170, at 180 (2005) provided: Section 17(i) of
    the bill [H.R. 1442, enacted as Pub. L. 109-304] amends section
    5501(a) of the Oceans Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-587, 106 Stat.
    5084) [see note above] by adding a new paragraph (3). The intent of
    this amendment is to maintain the status quo under paragraph (2) of
    section 5501(a) of that Act, as it exists prior to the enactment of
    this codification legislation. Section 55109 of title 46, United
    States Code, as contained in this bill, is intended as a
    codification without substantive change of section 1 of the Act of
    May 28, 1906, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 292). Therefore, the
    exceptions from that latter provision, which currently exist under
    such paragraph (2), are intended to continue to exist to the same
    extent under new section 55109 of title 46. In addition, if the
    original intent of such paragraph (2) was that the restriction
    contained in the pre-1992 amended version of that 1906 provision
    continues to apply to the vessels, persons, and entities described
    in such paragraph (2), then that outcome is intended to remain
    unchanged by this legislation, despite the repeal by this
    legislation of that 1906 provision. No expression as to the
    original intent of such paragraph (2) is intended by this
    legislation.]

    Sec. 55111. Towing

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Except when towing a vessel in distress, a
    vessel may not do any part of any towing described in subsection
    (b) unless the towing vessel - 
        (1) is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for
      purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and
        (2) has been issued a certificate of documentation with a
      coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of this title or is
      exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for
      such a certificate and endorsement.

      (b) Applicable Towing. - Subsection (a) applies to the towing of -
     
        (1) a vessel between ports or places in the United States to
      which the coastwise laws apply, either directly or via a foreign
      port or place;

      another vessel in violation of this section are each liable for a
      penalty of at least $350 but not more than $1,100. A penalty
      under this paragraph constitutes a lien on the vessel. The lien
      is enforceable in a district court of the United States for any
      district in which the vessel is found. Clearance may not be
      granted to the vessel until the penalties have been paid.
        (2) Vessel. - In addition to the penalties under paragraph (1),
      the towing vessel is liable for a penalty of $60 per ton based on
      the tonnage of each towed vessel.

      In subsection (a), the words "or to do any part of such towing"
    and "other than a vessel in distress" in the source provision are
    made applicable to all the towing described in subsection (b) for
    clarity and consistency. In paragraph (1), the words "wholly owned

    is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the laws

    the coastwise laws apply" are substituted for "in the United
    States, its Territories or possessions, embraced within the

    "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title and because of
    section 55101 of the revised title.
      In subsection (b)(3), the words "or place" are omitted as
    surplus. The words "as defined in the Presidential Proclamation of
    March 10, 1983" are omitted because "exclusive economic zone" is
    defined in chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In subsection (c), the penalty amounts reflect the adjustment for
    inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation
    Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note). See 19 C.F.R. Sec.
    4.92 (2004). In paragraph (2), the words "which sum may be
    recovered by way of libel or suit" are omitted as surplus.
      The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 316(b) is omitted as unnecessary
    because of the definition of "person" in section 1 of title 1.

    Sec. 55113. Use of foreign documented oil spill response vessels

-STATUTE-
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an oil spill response
    vessel documented under the laws of a foreign country may operate
    in waters of the United States on an emergency and temporary basis,
    for the purpose of recovering, transporting, and unloading in a
    United States port oil discharged as a result of an oil spill in or
    near those waters, if - 
        (1) an adequate number and type of oil spill response vessels
      documented under the laws of the United States cannot be engaged
      to recover oil from an oil spill in or near those waters in a
      timely manner, as determined by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator
      for a discharge or threat of a discharge of oil; and
        (2) the foreign country has by its laws accorded to vessels of
      the United States the same privileges accorded to vessels of the
      foreign country under this section.

    Sec. 55114. Unloading fish from foreign vessels

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prohibitions. - Except as otherwise provided by this section
    or a treaty or convention to which the United States is a party, a
    foreign vessel may not unload, in a port of the United States - 
        (1) its catch of fish taken on board on the high seas or fish
      products processed from that catch of fish; or
        (2) fish or fish products taken on board that vessel on the
      high seas from a vessel engaged in fishing operations or the
      processing of fish or fish products.

      (b) Regulations on Obtaining Information. - The Secretary of
    Commerce may prescribe regulations the Secretary considers
    necessary to obtain information on the transportation of fish
    products by vessels of the United States for foreign fish
    processing vessels to points in the United States.
      (c) Virgin Islands. - 
        (1) In general. - A foreign vessel of not more than 50 feet
      overall in length may unload its catch of fresh fish (whole or
      with the heads, viscera, or fins removed, but not frozen,
      otherwise processed, or further advanced) in a port of the Virgin
      Islands for immediate consumption in those islands. Fish unloaded
      under this paragraph may be sold or transferred only for
      immediate consumption. In the absence of satisfactory evidence
      that a sale or transfer to an agent, representative, or employee
      of a freezer or cannery is for immediate consumption, the sale or
      transfer is deemed not to be for immediate consumption. This
      paragraph does not prohibit the freezing, smoking, or other
      processing of fresh fish by the ultimate consumer of the fish.
        (2) Seizure, forfeiture, and penalty. - Fish unloaded in the
      Virgin Islands that are retained, sold, or transferred, except as
      allowed by paragraph (1), are liable to seizure by and forfeiture
      to the United States Government. A person retaining, selling,
      transferring, buying, or receiving the fish is liable to the
      Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
      violation. A penalty or forfeiture under this paragraph may be
      compromised, modified, or remitted under section 2107(b) of this
      title.

      (d) Northern Mariana Islands. - Subsection (a) does not apply to
    the Northern Mariana Islands.

-STATUTE-
      A foreign railroad, whose road enters the United States by ferry,
    tugboat, or towboat, may own and operate a vessel not having a
    coastwise endorsement in connection with the water transportation
    of the passenger, freight, express, baggage, and mail cars used by
    that road, together with the passengers, freight, express matter,
    baggage, and mails transported in those cars. However, the foreign
    railroad is subject to the same restrictions imposed by law on a
    vessel of the United States entering a port of the United States
    from the same foreign country. Except as otherwise authorized by
    this chapter, the ferry, tugboat, or towboat may not, under penalty
    of forfeiture, be used in the transportation of merchandise between
    ports or places in the United States to which the coastwise laws
    apply.

    vessel described in 46 App. U.S.C. 316(a)) for clarity and because
    of the reorganization of the source material in the revised title.
    The words "However, the foreign railroad is subject to the same
    restrictions imposed by law on a vessel of the United States
    entering a port of the United States from the same foreign country"
    are substituted for "without being subject to any other or
    different restrictions than those imposed by law on any vessel of
    the United States entering ports of the United States from ports in
    the same foreign country" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words
    "Except as otherwise authorized by this chapter" are substituted
    for "except as authorized by section 883 of this Appendix" because
    of the reorganization of the source material in the revised title.
    The words "its Territories or possessions" are omitted as
    unnecessary because of the definition of "United States" in chapter
    1 of the revised title.

-STATUTE-
      A vessel engaged in the coastwise transportation of coal produced

    the Secretary of Transportation finds that it is in the national
    interest, the Secretary may eliminate this priority loading at any
    port. The Secretary shall report to Congress within 30 days an
    action eliminating priority loading under this section.

-STATUTE-
      It is the sense of Congress that any loans made by an
    instrumentality of the United States Government to foster the
    exporting of agricultural or other products shall provide that the
    products may be transported only on vessels of the United States
    unless, as to any or all of those products, the Secretary of
    Transportation, after investigation, certifies to the
    instrumentality that vessels of the United States are not available
    in sufficient number, in sufficient tonnage capacity, on necessary
    schedules, or at reasonable rates.

      This section codifies the Joint Resolution of March 26, 1934 (ch.
    90, 48 Stat. 500) (also commonly known as Public Resolution 17).
    The codification of this provision is not intended to change its
    status as a "Sense of Congress" provision in any way. The words
    "Reconstruction Finance Corporation or" are omitted as obsolete
    because the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was abolished by
    section 6 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1957 (5 App. U.S.C.).

    Sec. 55305. Cargoes procured, furnished, or financed by the United
      States Government

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "privately-owned
    commercial vessel of the United States" does not include a vessel
    that, after September 21, 1961, was built or rebuilt outside the
    United States or documented under the laws of a foreign country,
    until the vessel has been documented under the laws of the United
    States for at least 3 years.
      (b) Minimum Tonnage. - When the United States Government
    procures, contracts for, or otherwise obtains for its own account,
    or furnishes to or for the account of a foreign country,
    organization, or persons without provision for reimbursement, any
    equipment, materials, or commodities, or provides financing in any
    way with Federal funds for the account of any persons unless
    otherwise exempted, within or without the United States, or
    advances funds or credits, or guarantees the convertibility of
    foreign currencies in connection with the furnishing or obtaining
    of the equipment, materials, or commodities, the appropriate
    agencies shall take steps necessary and practicable to ensure that
    at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage of the equipment,
    materials, or commodities (computed separately for dry bulk
    carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) which may be transported
    on ocean vessels is transported on privately-owned commercial
    vessels of the United States, to the extent those vessels are
    available at fair and reasonable rates for commercial vessels of
    the United States, in a manner that will ensure a fair and
    reasonable participation of commercial vessels of the United States
    in those cargoes by geographic areas.
      (c) Waivers. - The President, the Secretary of Defense, or
    Congress (by concurrent resolution or otherwise) may waive this
    section temporarily by - 
        (1) declaring the existence of an emergency justifying a
      waiver; and
        (2) notifying the appropriate agencies of the waiver.

      (d) Programs of Other Agencies. - 
        (1) Each department or agency that has responsibility for a
      program under this section shall administer that program with
      respect to this section under regulations and guidance issued by
      the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary, after consulting
      with the department or agency or organization or person involved,
      shall have the sole responsibility for determining if a program
      is subject to the requirements of this section.
        (2) The Secretary - 
          (A) shall conduct an annual review of the administration of
        programs determined pursuant to paragraph (1) as subject to the
        requirements of this section;
          (B) may direct agencies to require the transportation on
        United States-flagged vessels of cargo shipments not otherwise
        subject to this section in equivalent amounts to cargo
        determined to have been shipped on foreign carriers in
        violation of this section;
          (C) may impose on any person that violates this section, or a
        regulation prescribed under this section, a civil penalty of
        not more than $25,000 for each violation willfully and
        knowingly committed, with each day of a continuing violation
        following the date of shipment to be a separate violation; and
          (D) may take other measures as appropriate under the Federal
        Acquisition Regulations issued pursuant to section 25(c)(1)
        (!1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C.
        421(c)(1) (!2) or contract with respect to each violation.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Findings. - Congress finds that - 
        (1) a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a strong
      and active United States maritime industry are vitally important
      to the economic well-being and security of the United States;
        (2) both industries must compete in international markets
      increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the
      subsidization practices of foreign governments; and
        (3) increased agricultural exports and the use of merchant
      vessels of the United States contribute positively to the United
      States balance of trade and generate employment opportunities in
      the United States.

      (b) Purposes. - The purposes of this subchapter are to - 
        (1) enable the Secretary of Agriculture to plan export programs
      effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements
      applicable to those programs;
        (2) take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of
      the cargo-carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;
        (3) expand international trade in United States agricultural
      commodities and products and develop, maintain, and expand
      markets for United States agricultural exports;
        (4) improve the efficiency of administration of both the
      commodity purchasing and selling activities and the ocean
      transportation activities associated with export programs
      sponsored by the Secretary;
        (5) stimulate and promote the agricultural and maritime
      industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts
      by both industries to address their common problems; and
        (6) provide for the appropriate disposition of these findings
      and purposes.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 55314. Transportation requirements for certain exports
      sponsored by the Secretary of Agriculture

-STATUTE-
      (a) Minimum Tonnage. - 
        (1) In general. - In addition to the requirement under section
      55305 of this title for the transportation of a percentage of
      gross tonnage on commercial vessels of the United States, 25
      percent of the gross tonnage of agricultural commodities or their
      products specified in subsection (b) shall be transported each
      fiscal year on commercial vessels of the United States that - 
          (A) are necessary for national security; and
          (B) if more than 25 years old, were rebuilt within the last 5
        years and certified by the Secretary of Transportation as
        having a useful life of at least 5 years after that rebuilding.

        (2) Fiscal year. - To provide for effective and equitable
      administration of the cargo preference laws, the fiscal year for
      the purpose of compliance with minimum percentage requirements is
      the 12-month period beginning October 1 of each year.

      (b) Applicable Export Activity. - This section applies to export
    activity (except inspection or weighing activities, other
    activities carried out for health or safety, or technical
    assistance provided in the handling of commercial transactions) of
    the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commodity Credit Corporation - 
        (1) carried out under the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1691 et
      seq.);
        (2) carried out under section 416 of the Agricultural Act of
      1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431);
        (3) carried out under the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust Act
      (7 U.S.C. 1736f-1);
        (4) under which agricultural commodities or their products are -
       
          (A) donated through foreign governments or private or public
        agencies, including intergovernmental organizations; or
          (B) sold for foreign currencies or for dollars on credit
        terms of more than 10 years;

        (5) under which agricultural commodities or their products are
      made available for emergency food relief at less than prevailing
      world market prices;
        (6) under which a cash grant is made directly or through an
      intermediary to a foreign purchaser to enable the purchaser to
      obtain United States agricultural commodities or their products
      in an amount greater than the difference between the prevailing
      world market price and the United States market price, free along
      side vessel at a United States port; or
        (7) under which agricultural commodities owned or controlled by
      or under loan from the Corporation are exchanged or bartered for
      materials, goods, equipment, or services produced in foreign
      countries, except export activities described in section 55313(5)
      of this title.

      (c) Additional Requirements. - 
        (1) Application of section 55305. - The requirement for
      transportation on vessels of the United States under subsection
      (a) is subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in
      section 55305 of this title.
        (2) Allocation of commodities. - Subject to paragraph (3), in
      carrying out this section and section 55305 of this title, the
      Corporation shall take steps necessary and practicable, and
      consistent with this section and section 55305, without detriment
      to any port range to allocate, on the principle of lowest landed
      cost without regard to the country of registry of the vessel, 25
      percent of the bagged, processed, or fortified commodities
      provided under title II of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1721
      et seq.).
        (3) Calculations. - In carrying out paragraph (2), first there
      shall be calculated the allocation of 100 percent of the quantity
      to be procured on an overall lowest landed cost basis without
      regard to the country of registry of the vessel, and then there
      shall be allocated to the Great Lakes port range any cargoes for
      which it has the lowest landed cost under that calculation. The
      requirements for transportation on vessels of the United States
      under this section and section 55305 of this title do not apply
      to commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port range under
      paragraph (2). Commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port
      range under paragraph (2) may not be reallocated or diverted to
      another port range to meet those requirements to the extent that
      the total tonnage of commodities to which paragraph (2) applies
      that is furnished and transported from the Great Lakes port range
      is less than 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of the
      commodities furnished.
        (4) Awarding contracts. - In awarding a contract for the
      transportation by vessel of commodities from the Great Lakes port
      range pursuant to an export activity referred to in subsection
      (b), an agency - 
          (A) shall consider expressions of freight interest for any
        vessel from a vessel operator who meets reasonable requirements
        for financial and operational integrity; and
          (B) may not deny award of the contract to a person based on
        the type of vessel on which the transportation would be
        provided (including on the basis that the transportation would
        not be provided on a liner vessel, as that term is used in the
        Shipping Act of 1984, as in effect on November 14, 1995), if
        the person otherwise satisfies reasonable requirements for
        financial and operational integrity.

        (5) Nonavailability of vessels. - A determination of
      nonavailability of vessels of the United States resulting from
      the application of this subsection may not reduce the gross
      tonnage of commodities required by this section and section 55305
      of this title to be transported on vessels of the United States.

    Sec. 55316. Financing the transportation of agricultural
      commodities

-STATUTE-
      (a) Financing of Increased Charges. - The Secretary of
    Transportation shall finance any increased ocean freight charges
    incurred in any fiscal year that result from the application of
    section 55314 of this title.
      (b) Reimbursement of Increased Charges. - 
        (1) In general. - The Secretary of Transportation shall
      reimburse the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commodity Credit
      Corporation for the amount by which, in any fiscal year - 
          (A) the total cost of ocean freight and ocean freight
        differential for which obligations are incurred by the
        Secretary of Agriculture and the Corporation on exports of
        agricultural commodities and their products under the
        agricultural export programs specified in section 55314(b) of
        this title; exceeds
          (B) 20 percent of the value of the commodities and their
        products and the cost of the ocean freight and ocean freight
        differential on which obligations are incurred by the Secretary
        of Agriculture and the Corporation during that fiscal year.

        (2) Commodities shipped from inventory. - For purposes of this
      subsection, commodities shipped from the inventory of the
      Corporation shall be valued as provided in section 412(d) of the
      Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1736f(d)).

      (c) Issuance and Purchase of Obligations. - 
        (1) Issuance. - To meet the expenses required to be assumed
      under subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of Transportation
      shall issue obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury. The
      Secretary of Transportation, with the approval of the Secretary
      of the Treasury, shall prescribe the form, denomination,
      maturity, and other terms (except the interest rate) of the
      obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall set the interest
      rate for the obligations, considering the average market yield on
      outstanding marketable obligations of the United States
      Government of comparable maturities during the month before the
      obligations are issued.
        (2) Purchase. - The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase
      the obligations issued under this subsection. To purchase the
      obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public
      debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of securities issued
      under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities
      may be issued under that chapter are extended to include the
      purchase of obligations under this subsection. A redemption or
      purchase of the obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury is a
      public debt transaction of the Government.

      (d) Source of Funds for Reimbursement. - Reimbursement of the
    Secretary of Transportation for costs incurred under this section
    shall be made with appropriated funds rather than through
    cancellation of notes.
      (e) Appropriations. - 
        (1) Authorization. - Each fiscal year, there is authorized to
      be appropriated an amount sufficient to reimburse the Secretary
      of Transportation for the costs incurred under this section,
      including administrative expenses and the principal and interest
      due on obligations issued to the Secretary of the Treasury.
        (2) Appropriation for administrative expenses. - Each fiscal
      year, such amounts as may be necessary are hereby appropriated to
      pay interest and to liquidate debt on obligations issued to the
      Secretary of the Treasury under this section.

      (f) Notification to Congress of Insufficiency. - If the Secretary
    of Transportation is unable to obtain the funds necessary to
    finance the increased ocean freight charges resulting from the
    requirements of subsections (a) and (b) and section 55314(a) of
    this title, the Secretary shall notify Congress within 10 working
    days of the discovery of the insufficiency.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 55601. Short sea transportation program

-STATUTE-
      (a) Establishment. - The Secretary of Transportation shall
    establish a short sea transportation program and designate short
    sea transportation projects to be conducted under the program to
    mitigate landside congestion.
      (b) Program Elements. - The program shall encourage the use of
    short sea transportation through the development and expansion of -
    
        (1) documented vessels;
        (2) shipper utilization;
        (3) port and landside infrastructure; and
        (4) marine transportation strategies by State and local
      governments.

      (c) Short Sea Transportation Routes. - The Secretary shall
    designate short sea transportation routes as extensions of the
    surface transportation system to focus public and private efforts
    to use the waterways to relieve landside congestion along coastal
    corridors. The Secretary may collect and disseminate data for the
    designation and delineation of short sea transportation routes.
      (d) Project Designation. - The Secretary may designate a project
    to be a short sea transportation project if the Secretary
    determines that the project may - 
        (1) offer a waterborne alternative to available landside
      transportation services using documented vessels; and
        (2) provide transportation services for passengers or freight
      (or both) that may reduce congestion on landside infrastructure
      using documented vessels.

      (e) Elements of Program. - For a short sea transportation project
    designated under this section, the Secretary may - 
        (1) promote the development of short sea transportation
      services;
        (2) coordinate, with ports, State departments of
      transportation, localities, other public agencies, and the
      private sector and on the development of landside facilities and
      infrastructure to support short sea transportation services; and
        (3) develop performance measures for the short sea
      transportation program.

      (f) Multistate, State and Regional Transportation Planning. - The
    Secretary, in consultation with Federal entities and State and
    local governments, shall develop strategies to encourage the use of
    short sea transportation for transportation of passengers and
    cargo. The Secretary shall - 
        (1) assess the extent to which States and local governments
      include short sea transportation and other marine transportation
      solutions in their transportation planning;
        (2) encourage State departments of transportation to develop
      strategies, where appropriate, to incorporate short sea
      transportation, ferries, and other marine transportation
      solutions for regional and interstate transport of freight and
      passengers in their transportation planning; and
        (3) encourage groups of States and multi-State transportation
      entities to determine how short sea transportation can address
      congestion, bottlenecks, and other interstate transportation
      challenges.

      (g) Grants. - 
        (1) In general. - The Secretary shall establish and implement a
      short sea transportation grant program to implement projects or
      components of a project designated under subsection (d).
        (2) Applications. - In order to receive a grant under the
      program, an applicant shall - 
          (A) submit an application to the Secretary, in such form and
        manner, at such time, and containing such information as the
        Secretary may require; and
          (B) demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that - 
            (i) the project is financially viable;
            (ii) the funds received will be spent efficiently and
          effectively; and
            (iii) a market exists for the services of the proposed
          project as evidenced by contracts or written statements of
          intent from potential customers.

        (3) Non-federal share. - An applicant shall provide at least 20
      percent of the project costs from non-Federal sources. In
      awarding grants under the program, the Secretary shall give a
      preference to those projects or components that present the most
      financially viable transportation services and require the lowest
      percentage Federal share of the costs.

      In subsection (a), the text of 46 App. U.S.C. 808a is omitted as

    United States" are omitted as unnecessary because ownership by a
    citizen is a requirement for documentation. See section 12103 as
    revised by the bill.
      In subsection (c), before paragraph (1), the words
    "Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the Merchant
    Marine Act, 1936, or any contract with the Secretary made under

    [46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], or any contract entered into with
    the Secretary of Transportation under that Act" because the

    subtitle, but other provisions of that Act are being neither

      part by a citizen of the United States or a corporation
      incorporated under the laws of the United States or of a State;
        (2) sell, mortgage, lease, charter, deliver, or in any other
      manner transfer, or agree to sell, mortgage, lease, charter,
      deliver, or in any other manner transfer, to a person not a
      citizen of the United States - 
          (A) a vessel owned as described in paragraph (1), or an
        interest therein;
          (B) a vessel documented under the laws of the United States,
        or an interest therein; or
          (C) a facility for building or repairing vessels, or an
        interest therein;

        (3) issue, assign, or transfer to a person not a citizen of the
      United States an instrument of indebtedness secured by a mortgage
      of a vessel to a trustee, by an assignment of an owner's interest
      in a vessel under construction to a trustee, or by a mortgage of
      a facility for building or repairing vessels to a trustee, unless
      the trustee or a substitute trustee is approved by the Secretary
      under subsection (b);
        (4) enter into an agreement or understanding to construct a
      vessel in the United States for, or to be delivered to, a person
      not a citizen of the United States without expressly stipulating
      that construction will not begin until after the war or national
      emergency has ended;
        (5) enter into an agreement or understanding whereby there is
      vested in, or for the benefit of, a person not a citizen of the
      United States the controlling interest in a corporation that is
      incorporated under the laws of the United States or a State and
      that owns a vessel or facility for building or repairing vessels;
      or
        (6) cause or procure a vessel, constructed in whole or in part
      in the United States and never cleared for a foreign port, to
      depart from a port of the United States before it has been
      documented under the laws of the United States.

      (b) Trustees. - 
        (1) Approval. - The Secretary shall approve a trustee or
      substitute trustee under subsection (a)(3) if and only if the
      trustee is a bank or trust company that - 
          (A) is organized as a corporation, and is doing business,
        under the laws of the United States or a State;
          (B) is authorized under those laws to exercise corporate
        trust powers;
          (C) is a citizen of the United States;
          (D) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
        State authority; and

        most recent published report of condition) of at least
        $3,000,000.

        (2) Disapproval. - If a trustee or substitute trustee ceases to
      meet the conditions in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall
      disapprove the trustee or substitute trustee. After the
      disapproval, the restrictions on transfer or assignment without
      the Secretary's approval in subsection (a)(3) apply.
        (3) Operation of vessel. - During a period when subsection (a)
      applies, a trustee referred to in subsection (a)(3), even though
      approved as a trustee by the Secretary, may not operate the
      vessel under the mortgage or assignment without the Secretary's
      approval.

      (c) Status of Prohibited Transaction. - A transaction in
    violation of this section is void.
      (d) Recovery of Consideration. - 
        (1) In general. - A person that deposited or paid consideration
      in connection with a transaction prohibited by this section may
      recover the consideration after tender of the vessel, facility,
      stock, or other security, or interest therein, to the person
      entitled to it, or the forfeiture thereof to the United States
      Government.
        (2) Exception. - Paragraph (1) does not apply if the person in
      whose interest the consideration was deposited, or to whom it was
      paid, entered into the transaction in the belief that the person
      depositing or paying the consideration was a citizen of the
      United States.

      (e) Penalties. - 
        (1) Criminal penalty. - A person that violates, or attempts or
      conspires to violate, this section shall be fined under title 18,
      imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both.
        (2) Forfeiture. - The following shall be forfeited to the
      Government:
          (A) A vessel, a facility for building or repairing vessels,
        or an interest in a vessel or such a facility, that is sold,
        mortgaged, leased, chartered, delivered, transferred, or
        documented, or agreed to be sold, mortgaged, leased, chartered,
        delivered, transferred, or documented, in violation of this
        section.
          (B) Stock and other securities sold or transferred, or agreed
        to be sold or transferred, in violation of this section.
          (C) A vessel departing in violation of subsection (a)(6).

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

      In this section, the words "facility for building or repairing
    vessels" are substituted for "shipyard, dry dock, shipbuilding or
    ship-repairing plant or facility" (or similar language) to
    eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (a)(1), the words "transfer to" and "or flag" are
    omitted as surplus. The words "Territory, District, or possession
    thereof" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of
    "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In subsection (a)(3), the words "instrument of indebtedness" are
    substituted for "bond, note, or other evidence of indebtedness" to
    eliminate unnecessary words. The words "right, title, or" are
    omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (a)(5), the words "or the majority of the voting
    power" are omitted as covered by "controlling interest".
      In subsection (b)(1), before subparagraph (A), the words "and
    only if" are added for clarity because the Secretary is required to
    disapprove a trustee that ceases to meet the specified conditions.
      Subsections (c) and (d) are substituted for the source provisions
    to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (e)(1), the words "guilty of a misdemeanor" are
    omitted, and the words "fined under title 18" are substituted for
    "punishable by a fine of not more than $5000", because of chapter
    227 of title 18.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - A forfeiture under this chapter may be enforced
    in the same way as a forfeiture under the laws on the collection of
    duties. However, such a forfeiture may be remitted without seizure
    of the vessel.
      (b) Prior Convictions. - In a proceeding under this chapter to
    enforce a forfeiture, a prior criminal conviction of a person for a
    violation of this chapter with respect to the subject matter of the
    forfeiture is prima facie evidence of the violation against the
    person convicted.

      The words "or other watercraft" are omitted because of the
    definition of "vessel" in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words
    "The termination of any emergency so declared shall be announced by
    a further proclamation by the President" are omitted as superseded
    by the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).

      In subsection (a), the words "requisitioned for use but not
    ownership under this chapter" are substituted for "taken and used
    under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not
    required by the United States" to eliminate unnecessary words. The
    word "requisition" is substituted for "taking", and the word
    "vessel" is substituted for "such property", for consistency.
      Subsection (b) is added because the provisions about disputed
    compensation, for both charter use and other takings, are
    consolidated in section 56304 of the revised title to avoid

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - As soon as practicable, the Secretary of
    Transportation shall determine and pay just compensation for a
    vessel requisitioned under this chapter.
      (b) Factors Not Affecting Value. - The value of a vessel may not
    be considered enhanced by the circumstances requiring its
    requisition. Consequential damages arising from the requisition may
    not be paid.
      (c) Effect of Construction-Differential Subsidy. - 
        (1) If paid. - If a construction-differential subsidy has been
      paid for the vessel, the value of the vessel at the time of
      requisition shall be determined under section 802 of the Merchant
      Marine Act, 1936.
        (2) If not paid. - If a construction-differential subsidy has
      not been paid for the vessel, the value of any national defense
      features previously paid for by the United States Government
      shall be excluded.

      (d) Loss or Damage During Charter. - If a vessel is lost or
    damaged by a risk assumed by the Government under the charter, but
    a valuation for the vessel or a means of compensation has not been
    agreed to, the Secretary shall pay just compensation for the loss
    or damage, to the extent the person is not reimbursed through
    insurance.

      (b) Deposit in Treasury. - 
        (1) In general. - If an encumbrance exists, the Secretary of
      Transportation may deposit part of the compensation or advance of

      Secretary shall publish notice of the creation of the fund in the
      Federal Register.
        (2) Availability of amounts deposited. - Amounts deposited in
      the fund shall be available to pay the compensation or any of the

      the United States or a State) existing at the time the vessel was
      requisitioned.

      (c) Civil Action. - 
        (1) In general. - Within 6 months after publication of notice
      under subsection (b), the holder of an encumbrance may bring a
      civil action in admiralty, according to the principles of libels
      in rem, against the fund.
        (2) Venue. - The action must be brought in the district court
      of the United States - 
          (A) from whose custody the vessel was or may be
        requisitioned; or
          (B) in whose district the vessel was located when it was
        requisitioned.

        (3) Service of process. - Service of process shall be made on
      the appropriate United States Attorney, the Attorney General, and
      the Secretary, in the manner provided by the Federal Rules of

      In this section, the words "encumbrance" and "encumbrances" are
    substituted for "any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime
    claim or attachment lien" and "any valid claim by way of mortgage
    or maritime lien or attachment lien" to eliminate unnecessary
    words.
      In subsection (b)(1), the words "The Secretary shall publish
    notice of the creation of the fund in the Federal Register" are
    added for clarity, based on language barring a civil action not
    brought within 6 months after publication of such a notice.
      In subsection (c)(1), the words "Within 6 months after
    publication of notice under subsection (b)" are substituted for
    "prior to June 30, 1943, or within six months after the first such
    deposit with the Treasurer and publication of notice thereof in the
    Federal Register, whichever date is later" for clarity and to
    eliminate obsolete language.
      Subsection (c)(3) is substituted for "and such suit shall be
    commenced in the manner provided by section 742 of this Appendix
    and service of process shall be made in the manner therein provided
    by service upon the United States attorney and by mailing by
    registered mail to the Attorney General and the Secretary of
    Transportation and due notice shall under order of the court be
    given to all interested persons" because the relevant sentences in
    46 App. U.S.C. 742 were struck by an amendment in 1996. See
    generally Henderson v. United States, 517 U.S. 654, 116 S. Ct. 1638
    (1996).
      In subsection (c)(4), the words "any decree in said suit shall be
    paid out of the first and all subsequent deposits of compensation"
    and "any decree shall be subject to appeal and revision as now
    provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" are
    omitted as surplus.

    Sec. 56502. Adjusting obligations and arranging maintenance

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - On written application, the Secretary of
    Transportation may adjust obligations and arrange for maintenance
    of an essential vessel as provided in this chapter if the Secretary
    determines, after any investigation or proceeding the Secretary
    considers desirable, that - 
        (1) the operation of the vessel in the service, route, or line
      to which it is assigned under this subtitle, or in which it
      otherwise would be operated, is not - 
          (A) lawful under the Neutrality Act of 1939 (22 U.S.C. 441 et
        seq.) or a proclamation issued under that Act; or
          (B) compatible with maintaining the availability of the
        vessel for national defense and commerce;

        (2) it is not feasible under existing law to employ the vessel
      in any other service or operation in foreign or domestic trade
      (except temporary or emergency operation under section
      56503(b)(5) of this title); and
        (3) the applicant, because of the restrictions of the
      Neutrality Act of 1939 (22 U.S.C. 441 et seq.) or the withdrawal
      of vessels for national defense under paragraph (1), is not
      earning or will not earn a reasonable return on the capital
      necessarily employed in its business.

      (b) Effective Period. - Adjustments and arrangements under
    subsection (a) shall continue in effect only as long as the
    circumstances described in subsection (a) continue to exist.

    Sec. 56503. Types of adjustments and arrangements

-STATUTE-
      (a) Suspension Requirements. - An adjustment or arrangement under
    this chapter shall include suspension of - 
        (1) the requirement to operate the vessel in foreign trade
      under the applicable operating-differential or construction-
      differential subsidy contract or mortgage or other agreement;
      and
        (2) the right to operating-differential subsidy for the vessel.

      (b) Discretionary Adjustments and Arrangements. - To the extent
    the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate to carry out
    the purposes of this subtitle, an adjustment or arrangement under
    this chapter may include any of the following:
        (1) Lay-up of the vessel by the owner or in the custody of the
      Secretary, with payment or reimbursement by the Secretary of
      necessary and proper expenses (including reasonable overhead and
      insurance) or a fixed periodic allowance instead of payment or
      reimbursement.
        (2) Postponement, for not more than the total period of the lay-
      up, of the maturity date of each installment of the principal of
      obligations to the United States Government for the vessel
      (regardless of whether the maturity date is during a lay-up
      period), or rearrangement of those maturities.
        (3) Postponement or cancellation of interest accruing on the
      obligations during a lay-up period.
        (4) Extension, for not more than the total period of the lay-
      up, of the 20-year life limitation for the vessel and other
      limitations and provisions of this subtitle based on a 20-year
      life.
        (5) Provision for temporary or emergency employment of the
      vessel (instead of lay-up) as may be practicable, with such
      arrangements for management of the vessel, payment of expenses,
      and application of the proceeds of the employment, as the
      Secretary may approve, with any period of operation being
      included as part of the lay-up period.
        (6) Payment to the Secretary, on termination of the
      arrangements with the applicant, of the applicant's net profits
      (earned while the arrangements were in effect) in excess of 10
      percent a year on the capital necessarily employed in the
      applicant's business, as reimbursement for obligations postponed
      or canceled and expenses incurred or paid by the Secretary under
      this section.

      (c) Laid-Up Vessels. - Under subsection (b)(6), capital of the
    applicant represented by a vessel of the applicant laid-up or
    operated under this section shall be included in capital
    necessarily employed in the applicant's business. The Secretary may
    require a vessel laid-up or operated under this section to be
    security for reimbursement.

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - If the Secretary of Transportation determines

    surety bond, with a surety approved by the Secretary, to ensure
    that the vessel will not be operated in the foreign trade of the
    United States at any time within 10 years after the sale, in
    competition with a vessel owned by a citizen of the United States
    and documented under the laws of the United States.

    Sec. 57103. Sale of obsolete vessels in National Defense Reserve
      Fleet

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary of Transportation may convey the
    right, title, and interest of the United States Government in any
    vessel of the National Defense Reserve Fleet that has been
    identified by the Secretary as an obsolete vessel of insufficient
    value to warrant its further preservation, if the recipient - 
        (1) is a non-profit organization, a State, or a municipal
      corporation or political subdivision of a State;
        (2) agrees not to use, or allow others to use, the vessel for
      commercial transportation purposes;
        (3) agrees to make the vessel available to the Government
      whenever the Secretary indicates that it is needed by the
      Government;
        (4) agrees to hold the Government harmless for any claims
      arising from exposure to asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls,
      lead paint, or other hazardous substances after conveyance of the
      vessel, except for claims arising from use of the vessel by the
      Government;
        (5) has a conveyance plan and a business plan that describes
      the intended use of the vessel, each of which has been submitted
      to and approved by the Secretary;
        (6) has provided proof, as determined by the Secretary, of
      resources sufficient to accomplish the transfer, necessary
      repairs and modifications, and initiation of the intended use of
      the vessel; and
        (7) agrees that when the recipient no longer requires the
      vessel for use as described in the business plan required under
      paragraph (5) - 
          (A) the recipient will, at the discretion of the Secretary,
        reconvey the vessel to the Government in good condition except
        for ordinary wear and tear; or
          (B) if the Board of Trustees of the recipient has decided to
        dissolve the recipient according to the laws of the State in
        which the recipient is incorporated, then - 
            (i) the recipient shall distribute the vessel, as an asset
          of the recipient, to a person that has been determined exempt
          from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
          Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or to the Federal
          Government or a State or local government for a public
          purpose; and
            (ii) the vessel shall be disposed of by a court of
          competent jurisdiction of the county in which the principal
          office of the recipient is located, for such purposes as the
          court shall determine, or to such organizations as the court
          shall determine are organized exclusively for public
          purposes.

      (b) Other Equipment. - At the Secretary's discretion, additional
    equipment from other obsolete vessels of the Fleet may be conveyed
    to assist the recipient with maintenance, repairs, or
    modifications.
      (c) Additional Terms. - The Secretary may require any additional
    terms the Secretary considers appropriate.
      (d) Delivery of Vessel. - If conveyance is made under this
    section, the vessel shall be delivered to the recipient at a time
    and place to be determined by the Secretary. The vessel shall be
    conveyed in an "as is" condition.
      (e) Limitations. - If at any time prior to delivery of the vessel
    to the recipient, the Secretary determines that a different
    disposition of the vessel would better serve the interests of the
    Government, the Secretary shall pursue the more favorable
    disposition of the obsolete vessel and shall not be liable for any
    damages that may result from an intended recipient's reliance upon
    a proposed transfer.
      (f) Reversion. - The Secretary shall include in any conveyance
    under this section terms under which all right, title, and interest
    conveyed by the Secretary shall revert to the Government if the
    Secretary determines the vessel has been used other than as
    described in the business plan required under subsection (a)(5).

      In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words
    "Notwithstanding section 1160(j) of this title" are omitted as
    unnecessary because section 46 App. U.S.C. 1160(j) is restated in
    section 57101 of the revised title and that section contains an
    exception which includes this section. In paragraph (1), the words
    "Commonwealth, or possession of the United States" and "or the
    District of Columbia" are omitted as unnecessary because of the
    definition of "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

    valued at their scrap value in domestic or foreign markets as of
    the date of the acquisition for or sale from the Fleet. However,

    Sec. 57105. Acquisition of vessels for essential services, routes,
      or lines

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary of Transportation may acquire a
    vessel, by purchase or otherwise, if - 
        (1) the Secretary considers the vessel necessary to establish,
      maintain, improve, or serve as a replacement on an essential
      service, route, or line in the foreign commerce of the United
      States, as determined under section 50103 of this title;
        (2) the vessel was constructed in the United States; and
        (3) the Secretary of the Navy has certified to the Secretary of
      Transportation that the vessel is suitable for economical and
      speedy conversion into a naval or military auxiliary or otherwise
      suitable for use by the United States Government in time of war
      or national emergency.

      (b) Price. - The price paid for the vessel shall be based on a
    fair and reasonable valuation. However, the price may not exceed by
    more than 5 percent the cost of the vessel to the owner (excluding
    any construction-differential subsidy and the cost of national
    defense features paid by the Secretary of Transportation) plus the
    actual cost previously expended for reconditioning, less
    depreciation based on a 25-year life for a dry-cargo or passenger
    vessel and a 20-year life for a tanker or other liquid bulk carrier
    vessel.
      (c) Documentation. - A vessel acquired under this section that is
    not documented under the laws of the United States at the time of
    acquisition shall be so documented as soon as practicable.

      In subsection (a), the words "and to pay for the same out of his

    fund established under 46 App. U.S.C. 1116 was impliedly abolished
    by 46 App. U.S.C. 1119, as amended.
      In subsection (b), the words "less depreciation based on a 25-
    year life for a dry-cargo or passenger vessel and a 20-year life
    for a tanker or other liquid bulk carrier vessel" are substituted
    for "less depreciation based upon a twenty-five year life
    expectancy of the vessel" because of section 9 of Public Law 86-518
    (June 12, 1960, 74 Stat. 217), which provided that "Nothing in any
    amendment made by this Act [including section 1 substituting
    'twenty-five' for 'twenty' in 46 App. U.S.C. 1125] shall operate or
    be interpreted to change from twenty to twenty-five years the
    provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, relating
    to the commercial expectancy or period of depreciation of any
    tanker or other liquid bulk carrier."

    Sec. 57305. Determination of trade-in allowance

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - The Secretary of Transportation shall determine
    the trade-in allowance for an obsolete vessel at the time of
    acquisition of the vessel. The allowance shall be the fair value of
    the vessel. In determining the value, the Secretary shall consider -
     
        (1) the scrap value of the obsolete vessel in American and
      foreign markets;
        (2) the depreciated value based on a 20-year or 25-year life,
      whichever applies to the obsolete vessel; and
        (3) the market value of the obsolete vessel for operation in
      world commerce or in the domestic or foreign commerce of the
      United States.

      (b) Use of Obsolete Vessels. - If acquisition of the obsolete
    vessel occurs when the owner contracts for the construction of the
    new vessel, and the owner uses the obsolete vessel during the
    period of construction of the new vessel, the Secretary shall
    reduce the trade-in allowance by an amount representing the fair
    value of that use. The Secretary shall establish the rate for use
    of the obsolete vessel when the contract for construction of the
    new vessel is made.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Acquisition at Time of Contract. - If acquisition of an
    obsolete vessel under this chapter occurs when the owner contracts
    for the construction or purchase of the new vessel, the Secretary
    of Transportation shall apply the trade-in allowance to the
    purchase price of the new vessel rather than paying it to the
    owner. If the new vessel is constructed under this subtitle, the
    Secretary may apply the trade-in allowance to the required cash
    payments on terms and conditions the Secretary may prescribe. If
    the new vessel is not constructed under this subtitle, the
    Secretary shall pay the trade-in allowance to the builder of the
    vessel for the account of the owner when the Secretary acquires the
    obsolete vessel.
      (b) Acquisition at Time of Delivery. - If acquisition of the
    obsolete vessel occurs when the new vessel is delivered to the
    owner, the Secretary shall deposit the trade-in allowance in the
    owner's capital construction fund.

    Sec. 57307. Recognition of gain for tax purposes

-STATUTE-
      The owner of an obsolete vessel does not recognize a gain under
    the Federal income tax laws when the vessel is transferred to the
    Secretary of Transportation in exchange for a trade-in allowance
    under this chapter. The basis of the new vessel acquired with the
    allowance is the same as the basis of the obsolete vessel - 
        (1) increased by the difference between the cost of the new
      vessel and the trade-in allowance of the obsolete vessel; and
        (2) decreased by the amount of loss recognized on the transfer.

    shall first determine that those routes are not being adequately
    served by existing steamship lines privately owned and operated by
    citizens of the United States and documented under the laws of the
    United States.
      (b) Policy To Encourage Private Operation. - The Secretary shall
    have a policy of encouraging private operation of each essential
    steamship line now owned by the United States Government by - 
        (1) selling the line to a citizen of the United States; or
        (2) demising the Secretary's vessels on bareboat charter to
      citizens of the United States who agree to maintain the line in
      the manner provided in this chapter.

    the charter, the cumulative net voyage profit (after payment of the
    charter hire reserved in the charter and payment of the charterer's
    fair and reasonable overhead expenses applicable to operation of
    the chartered vessel) exceeds 10 percent a year of the charterer's
    capital necessarily employed in the business of the chartered
    vessel, the charterer shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation,
    as additional charter hire, half the cumulative net voyage profit
    in excess of 10 percent a year. However, any cumulative net voyage
    profit accounted for under this subsection is not to be included in
    the calculation of cumulative net voyage profit in any subsequent
    year.
      (b) Terms To Be Defined and Used. - The Secretary shall define
    the terms "net voyage profit", "fair and reasonable overhead
    expenses", and "capital necessarily employed" for this section.
    Each advertisement for bids and each charter shall contain these
    definitions, stating the formula for determining each of these
    three amounts.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 57531. Construction and charter of vessels for unsuccessful
      routes

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - If the Secretary of Transportation finds that a
    trade route determined to be essential under section 50103 of this
    title cannot be successfully developed and maintained and the
    Secretary's replacement program cannot be achieved under private
    operation of the trade route by a citizen of the United States with
    vessels documented under chapter 121 of this title, without further
    aid by the United States Government in addition to the financial
    aid authorized under titles V and VI of the Merchant Marine Act,
    1936, the Secretary, without advertisement or competition, may - 
        (1) have constructed, in private shipyards or in navy yards,
      vessels of the types necessary for the trade route; and
        (2) demise charter those new vessels to the operator of vessels
      of the United States established on the trade route.

      (b) Amount of Charter Hire. - 
        (1) In general. - The annual charter hire under subsection (a)
      shall be at least 4 percent of the price (referred to in this
      section as the "foreign cost") at which the vessel would be sold
      if constructed under title V of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936,
      plus - 
          (A) a percentage of the depreciated foreign cost computed
        annually determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking
        into consideration the current average market yield on
        outstanding marketable obligations of the Government with
        remaining periods to maturity comparable to the term of the
        charter, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth percent; and
          (B) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of
        Transportation to cover administrative costs.

        (2) Depreciation. - Depreciation under paragraph (1)(A) shall
      be based on - 
          (A) a 25-year life for dry-cargo and passenger vessels; and
          (B) a 20-year life for tankers and other bulk liquid carrier
        vessels.

      (c) Option To Purchase. - The charter may contain an option to
    the charterer to purchase the vessels from the Secretary of
    Transportation within 5 years after delivery under the charter, on
    the same terms and conditions as provided in title V of the
    Merchant Marine Act, 1936, for the purchase of new vessels from the
    Secretary. However - 
        (1) the purchase price shall be the foreign cost less
      depreciation to the date of purchase based on the useful life
      specified in subsection (b)(2);
        (2) the required cash payment payable at the time of the
      purchase shall be 25 percent of the purchase price;
        (3) the charter may provide that any part of the charter hire
      paid in excess of the minimum charter hire provided for in this
      section may be credited against the cash payment payable at the
      time of the purchase;
        (4) the balance of the purchase price shall be paid within the
      remaining years of useful life (as specified in subsection
      (b)(2)) after the date of delivery of the vessel under the
      charter and in approximately equal annual installments, except
      that the first installment, which shall be payable on the next
      ensuing anniversary date of the delivery under the charter, shall
      be a proportionate part of the annual installment; and
        (5) interest shall be payable on the unpaid balances from the
      date of purchase, at a rate not less than - 
          (A) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,
        taking into consideration the current average market yield on
        outstanding marketable obligations of the Government with
        remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average
        maturities of the loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth
        percent; plus
          (B) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of
        Transportation to cover administrative costs.

      (d) Operation of Vessel. - 
        (1) Permissible voyages. - The charter shall provide for
      operation of the vessel exclusively - 
          (A) in foreign trade;
          (B) on a round-the-world voyage;
          (C) on a round voyage from the west coast of the United
        States to a European port that includes an intercoastal port of
        the United States;
          (D) on a round voyage from the Atlantic coast of the United
        States to the Orient that includes an intercoastal port of the
        United States; or
          (E) on a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop
        at Hawaii or an island territory or possession of the United
        States.

        (2) Domestic trade. - The charter shall provide if the vessel
      is operated in domestic trade on any of the services specified in
      paragraph (1), the charterer will pay annually to the Secretary
      of Transportation that proportion of  1/25  of the difference
      between the domestic and foreign cost of the vessel as the gross
      revenue derived from the domestic trade bears to the gross
      revenue derived from the entire voyages completed during the
      preceding year.

      In subsection (a)(2), the words "demise charter" are substituted
    for "demise . . . or bare-boat charter" to eliminate unnecessary

    substituted for "American-flag operator" for consistency in the
    revised title.
      Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for "Upon the basis of a twenty-
    five year life of the vessel" because of section 9 of Public Law

    in any amendment made by this Act [including section 5 substituting
    'twenty-five' for 'twenty' in 46 App. U.S.C. 1204] shall operate or
    be interpreted to change from twenty to twenty-five years the
    provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, relating
    to the commercial expectancy or period of depreciation of any
    tanker or other liquid bulk carrier."
      In subsection (c), in paragraphs (1) and (4), references to the
    useful life specified in subsection (b)(2) are substituted for
    references to the twenty-five year useful life for the reason
    stated in explaining subsection (b)(2).

    Sec. 57532. Operation of experimental vessels

-STATUTE-
      (a) Definition. - In this section, the term "experimental vessel"
    means a vessel owned by the United States Government (including a
    vessel in the National Defense Reserve Fleet) that has been
    constructed, reconditioned, or remodeled for experimental or
    testing purposes.
      (b) Authority To Operate. - The Secretary of Transportation, for
    the purpose of practical development, trial, and testing, may
    operate an experimental vessel under a bareboat charter or general
    agency agreement in the foreign or domestic trade of the United
    States or for use for the account of a department or agency of the
    Government, without regard to other provisions of this subtitle and
    other laws related to chartering and general agency operations. Not
    more than 10 vessels may be operated and tested under this section
    in any one year.
      (c) Terms of Operation. - Operation of a vessel under this
    section shall be on terms the Secretary considers appropriate to
    carry out the purposes of this subtitle. A bareboat charter under
    this section shall be at reasonable rates and include restrictions
    the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the public interest,
    including provisions for recapture of profits under section 57517
    of this title. A charter or general agency agreement under this
    section shall be reviewed annually to determine whether conditions
    exist to justify continuance of the charter or agreement.
      (d) Rights of Seamen. - A seaman engaged in vessel operations of
    the Secretary under this section and employed through a general
    agent in connection with a charter or agreement under this section
    is entitled to all the rights and remedies provided in sections
    1(a) and (c), 3(c), and 4 of the Act of March 24, 1943 (50 App.
    U.S.C. 1291(a), (c), 1293(c), 1294).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 58101. Operating in domestic intercoastal or coastwise service

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prohibition. - A subsidy may not be awarded or paid to a
    contractor under the operating-differential subsidy program, and a
    vessel may not be chartered to a person under chapter 575 of this
    title, if the contractor or charterer, or a holding company,
    subsidiary, affiliate, or associate of the contractor or charterer,
    or an officer, director, agent, or executive thereof, directly or
    indirectly - 
        (1) owns, charters, or operates a vessel engaged in the
      domestic intercoastal or coastwise service; or
        (2) owns a pecuniary interest in a person that owns, charters,
      or operates a vessel in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise
      service.

      (b) Waiver. - A person may apply to the Secretary of
    Transportation for a waiver of subsection (a). Before deciding on
    the waiver, the Secretary shall give the applicant and other
    interested persons an opportunity for a hearing. The Secretary may
    not grant the waiver if the Secretary finds it would - 
        (1) result in unfair competition to a person operating
      exclusively in the domestic intercoastal or coastwise service; or
        (2) be prejudicial to the objectives and policy of this
      subtitle.

      (c) Continuous Operation Since 1935. - The Secretary shall grant
    an application under subsection (b) without requiring further proof
    that the public interest and convenience will be served and without
    further proceedings as to the competition in the route or trade, if
    the contractor or other person, or a predecessor in interest, was
    in bona-fide operation as a common carrier by water in the domestic
    intercoastal or coastwise trade in 1935 over the route or in the
    trade for which the application is made and has so operated since
    that time or, if engaged in furnishing seasonal service only, was
    in bona-fide operation in 1935 during the season ordinarily covered
    by its operation, except in either event as to interruptions of
    service over which the applicant or its predecessor in interest had
    no control.
      (d) Diversion Into Intercoastal or Coastwise Operations. - If an
    application under subsection (b) is approved, a person referred to
    in this section may not divert, directly or indirectly, money,
    property, or any other thing of value, used in a foreign-trade
    operation for which a subsidy is paid by the United States
    Government, into intercoastal or coastwise operations.

      In this chapter, references to the "operating-differential
    subsidy program" are substituted for references to "part A of
    subchapter VI of this chapter", meaning 46 App. U.S.C. 1171-1185a,
    because part A of subchapter VI contains the operating-differential
    subsidy program and under 46 App. U.S.C. 1185a that program is
    being phased out. Consequently, part A is being omitted from the
    revised title and will instead appear as a note under section
    53101, except for 46 App. U.S.C. 1177 and 1177-l which are restated

    substituted for references to "subchapter VII of this chapter",
    meaning 46 App. U.S.C. 1191-1205, because those sections are
    restated in chapter 575.
      In subsection (b), the words "A person may apply to the Secretary
    of Transportation for a waiver of subsection (a). Before deciding
    on the waiver, the Secretary shall give the applicant and other
    interested persons an opportunity for a hearing." are substituted
    for "without the written permission of the Secretary of
    Transportation. Every person, firm, or corporation having any
    interest in such application shall be permitted to intervene and
    the Secretary of Transportation shall give a hearing to the
    applicant and the intervenors." for clarity.
      In subsection (c), the words "domestic intercoastal or coastwise
    trade" are substituted for "domestic, intercoastal, or coastwise
    trade" for consistency in the section.
      In subsection (d), the words "and whosoever shall violate this
    provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor" are omitted because
    section 3559 of title 18 provides for the classification of
    offenses. See the revision notes for section 58109 of the revised
    title.

    Sec. 58106. Concerted discriminatory activities

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prohibition. - A contractor receiving an operating-
    differential subsidy, or a charterer under chapter 575 of this
    title, may not continue as a party to or conform to an agreement
    with another carrier by water, or engage in a practice in concert
    with another carrier by water, that is unjustly discriminatory or
    unfair to any other citizen of the United States operating a common
    carrier by water employing only vessels documented under the laws
    of the United States on an established trade route from and to a
    United States port.
      (b) Government Payment Prohibited. - No payment or subsidy of any
    kind may be paid, directly or indirectly, out of funds of the
    United States Government to a contractor or charterer that has
    violated subsection (a).
      (c) Civil Action. - A person whose business or property is
    injured by a violation of subsection (a) may bring a civil action
    in the district court of the United States for the district in
    which the defendant resides, is found, or has an agent. If the
    person prevails, the person shall be awarded - 
        (1) 3 times the damages; and
        (2) costs, including reasonable attorney fees.

      In subsection (b), the words "United States Government" are

      In subsection (c), the words "bring a civil action" are
    substituted for "sue" for consistency in the revised title. The
    words "without respect to the amount in controversy" are omitted
    because section 1331 of title 28 no longer contains a requirement
    of any particular amount in controversy for jurisdiction of civil
    actions arising under the laws of the United States. The words "If
    the person prevails" are added for clarity.

    understanding, or otherwise, prevent or attempt to prevent any
    other common carrier by water from serving any port described in
    subsection (b) at the same rates the first carrier charges at the

        (1) designed for the accommodation of ocean-going vessels;
        (2) located on an improvement project authorized by law or by a
      Federal agency; and
        (3) located within the continental limits of the United States.

      (c) Other Authority Not Limited. - This section does not limit

    Sec. 58108. Charges for transportation subject to subtitle IV of
      title 49

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prohibition. - A carrier may not charge, collect, or receive
    for transportation subject to subtitle IV of title 49 of persons or
    property, under any joint rate, fare, or charge, or under any
    export, import, or other proportional rate, fare, or charge, that
    is based in whole or in part on the fact that the persons or
    property affected are to be transported to, or have been
    transported from, a port in a territory or possession of the United
    States or in a foreign country, by a carrier by water in foreign
    commerce, any lower rate, fare, or charge than the carrier charges,
    collects, or receives for the transportation of persons or similar
    property for the same distance, in the same direction, and over the
    same route, in commerce wholly within the United States, unless the
    vessel used for the transportation is or was at the time of the
    transportation documented under the laws of the United States.
      (b) Suspension of Prohibition. - Whenever the Secretary of
    Transportation believes that adequate shipping facilities to or
    from any port in a territory or possession of the United States or
    a foreign country are not being provided by vessels documented
    under the laws of the United States, the Secretary shall certify
    this fact to the Surface Transportation Board. On receiving the
    certification, the Board may by order suspend the operation of
    subsection (a) with respect to the rates, fares, and charges for
    the transportation by rail of persons and property transported from
    or to be transported to those ports, for such time and under such
    terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify in the order or
    in any supplemental order.
      (c) Termination of Suspension. - Whenever the Secretary believes
    that adequate shipping facilities are being provided to those ports
    by vessels documented under the laws of the United States, and
    certifies that fact to the Board, the Board may order the
    termination of the suspension.

      In subsection (a), the word "individual" is substituted for
    "natural person" for consistency in the revised title. The words
    "convicted of violating section 58101(d), 58103, or 58105 of this
    title" are substituted for "found guilty of any act or acts
    declared in this chapter to constitute a misdemeanor" because the
    sections referred to restate the provisions which declare certain
    acts to be misdemeanors and because the restatement of those
    provisions does not use the word "misdemeanor". The words "in any
    district court of the United States" are omitted as unnecessary.
    The words "shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for at least
    one year but not more than five years, or both" are substituted for
    "shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by
    imprisonment for not less than one year or more than five years, or
    by both fine and imprisonment" because of chapter 227 of title 18.
    See 18 U.S.C. 3559 (which classifies offenses based on the maximum
    term of imprisonment) and 3571 (which establishes fines based on
    those classifications).
      In subsection (b), the word "organization" is substituted for
    "corporation" to reflect the probable intent that the penalty
    should apply to other organizations in addition to corporations.
    The words "convicted of committing an act prohibited by this
    subtitle" are substituted for "found guilty of any act or acts
    declared in this chapter to be unlawful" for clarity and
    consistency. The words "shall be fined under title 18" are
    substituted for "shall be punished by a fine of not more than
    $25,000" for consistency with subsection (a).
      In subsection (c), the words "An individual or organization
    convicted of violating a section referred to in subsection (a)" are
    substituted for "any person or corporation convicted of a
    misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter" for consistency
    in the section. Reference to the Federal Maritime Commission is
    omitted because the Commission does not administer any of the
    provisions referred to.

      In subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security is
    substituted for the Commissioner of Customs because the functions
    of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury
    relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland
    Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002
    (Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the
    Commissioner of Customs previously were vested in the Secretary of
    the Treasury under section 321(c) of title 31. For prior related
    transfers of functions, see the transfer of functions note under 46
    App. U.S.C. 163. The word "shall" is substituted for "is authorized
    and directed to" for consistency in the revised title and to
    eliminate unnecessary words. The word "port" is substituted for
    "seaports" for consistency in the revised title. The word "secured"
    is substituted for "placed in security" to eliminate unnecessary
    words. The words "from time to time", "properly", and "and for that
    purpose to employ any of the officers of the United States Customs
    Service" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (b), the words "fined under title 18, imprisoned
    for not more than 6 months, or both" are substituted for "subject
    to a penalty of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed
    six months, or both" because of chapter 227 of title 18. The words
    "in the discretion of the court" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (c), the words "section 2279 of title 18" are
    substituted for "section forty-six hundred and six of the Revised
    Statutes" in the Act of Mar. 31, 1900, because R.S. Sec. 4606
    (formerly classified to 46 U.S.C. 708 (1946 ed.)) was replaced by
    18 U.S.C. 2279 in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June
    25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683). The words "section 9 of act
    August 2, 1882 (22 Stat. 189)" are omitted because that law was
    repealed by section 4(b) of Public Law 98-89 (Aug. 26, 1983, 97
    Stat. 600).

    the United States, on a voyage from a port in the United States,
    arrives at a foreign port, the master of the vessel shall deposit

      (b) Return of Certificate. - When the master produces a clearance
    from the appropriate officer of the foreign port, the consular
    officer shall return the certificate of documentation to the master
    if the master has complied with the provisions of law related to
    the discharge of seamen in a foreign country and the payment of
    fees of consular officers.

    the Secretary of Homeland Security before proceeding from a port or
    place in the United States -

      authorized data interchange system, to obtain the clearance;
        (2) permit clearance to be obtained before all requirements for
      clearance are complied with, but only if the owner or operator of
      the vessel files a bond in an amount set by the Secretary
      conditioned on the compliance by the owner or operator with all
      specified requirements for clearance within a time period (not

      In this section, the tax rates for fiscal years 1991 through 2002
    are omitted as obsolete.
      In subsection (a)(1), the words "West Indies Islands" are
    substituted for "West India Islands" to conform to current
    geographic terminology. The word "Newfoundland" is omitted because
    Newfoundland is now part of Canada.
      In subsection (a)(2), the reference to the definitions in section
    2101 is confined to "recreational vessel" because the definitions
    of "vessel of the United States" and "barge" are being moved to
    chapter 1 of the revised title and being made applicable title-

    first appeared in the 1958 edition of the United States Code for 46
    U.S.C. 121 says that the words apparently were omitted as
    superseded and repealed by section 14 of the Act of June 26, 1884
    (ch. 121, 23 Stat. 57), as amended by section 11 of the Act of June

-STATUTE-
      (a) Imposition of Tax. - A tax of 50 cents per ton, to be called
    "light money", is imposed on a vessel not of the United States at
    each entry in a port of the United States. This tax shall be
    imposed and collected under the same regulations that apply to
    tonnage taxes.
      (b) Exception for Vessels Owned by Citizens. - 
        (1) In general. - Subsection (a) does not apply to a vessel
      owned only by citizens of the United States if - 
          (A) the vessel is carrying a regular document issued by a
        customhouse of the United States proving the vessel to be owned
        only by citizens of the United States; and
          (B) on entry of the vessel from a foreign port, the
        individual designated under paragraph (2) states under oath
        that - 
            (i) the document contains the names of all the owners of
          the vessel; or
            (ii) part of the ownership has been transferred since the
          document was issued and, to the best of that individual's
          knowledge and belief, the vessel is still owned only by
          citizens of the United States.

        (2) Person to make statement. - The statement under paragraph
      (1)(B) shall be made by - 
          (A) an owner if one resides at the port of entry; or
          (B) the master if an owner does not reside at the port of
        entry.

      (c) Exception for Vessels Becoming Documented. - Subsection (a)
    section does not apply to a vessel that - 
        (1) is owned only by citizens of the United States; and
        (2) after entering a port of the United States, becomes
      documented as a vessel of the United States before leaving that
      port.

    time of war, concluded at The Hague on December 21, 1904, are
    satisfied. The President by proclamation shall name the vessels for
    which the conditions are satisfied and state when the exemption
    begins and ends.

    government of a foreign country that it has suspended, in any part,
    the imposition of discriminating duties for any class of vessels
    owned by citizens of the United States or goods imported in those
    vessels, the President may proclaim a reciprocal suspension of
    discriminating duties for the same class of vessels owned by
    citizens of that country or goods imported in those vessels.
      (b) Effective and Expiration Dates. - A suspension under this
    section takes effect retroactively from the date the President

    entering, clearing, or paying any duties or fees (including

    cruise in the waters of the United States without paying any duties
    or fees. However, the Secretary may require foreign yachts to
    obtain a license to cruise in the waters of the United States. The
    license shall be in the form prescribed by the Secretary and
    contain limitations about length of time, direction, place of
    cruising and action, and other matters the Secretary considers
    appropriate. The license shall be issued without cost to the yacht.

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - The President may proclaim a suspension
    of commercial privileges to vessels of a foreign country when - 
        (1) vessels of that country have been given the same commercial

      (b) Application. - A suspension under this section shall apply to
    the same commercial privileges denied to vessels of the United

      on the vessel may be seized by, and forfeited to, the United
      States Government.
        (2) Fine or imprisonment. - A person opposing an official of
      the Government enforcing this section shall be fined under title

      In this section, the words "vessels of the United States" are
    used instead of both "vessels of the United States" and "American
    vessels" for consistency in the section. The words "vessels of a
    foreign country" and "vessels of that country" are substituted for
    "foreign country whose vessels", "national vessels", "vessels of
    such foreign country", and similar references, for consistency. The
    words "ports and waters" and "ports or waters" are substituted for
    "ports", "harbors, ports, or waters", and "ports, harbors, or
    waters" for consistency.
      In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "on receiving
    satisfactory information of the continuance of such discriminations
    against any vessels of the United States" are omitted as
    unnecessary. In paragraph (1), the words "given the same commercial
    privileges" are substitued for "placed on the same footing" for
    clarity and for consistency in the section.
      Subsection (b) is substituted for "excluding . . . from the
    exercise of such commercial privileges in the ports of the United
    States as are denied to American vessels in the ports of such
    foreign country, all vessels of such foreign country of a similar
    character to the vessels of the United States thus discriminated
    against" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      Subsection (c) is substituted for "on and after such time as he
    may indicate" for clarity.
      Subsection (d)(1) is substituted for "and on and after the date
    named in such proclamation for it to take effect, if the master,
    officer, or agent of any vessel of such foreign country excluded by
    said proclamation from the exercise of any commercial privileges
    shall do any act prohibited by said proclamation in the ports,
    harbors, or waters of the United States for or on account of such
    vessel, such vessel, and its rigging, tackle, furniture, and boats,
    and all the goods on board, shall be liable to seizure and to
    forfeiture to the United States" for consistency in the revised
    title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
      Subsection (d)(2) is substituted for "any person opposing any
    officer of the United States in the enforcement of this section, or
    aiding and abetting any other person in such opposition, shall
    forfeit $800, and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon
    conviction, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not

    prohibit vessels of the British dominions of North America, their
    masters and crews, and products of or coming from those dominions,

        same manner and under the same regulations applicable to
        trading vessels of the most-favored-nation;
          (B) prevented from buying supplies allowed to be sold to
        trading vessels of the most-favored-nation; or
          (C) otherwise harassed; or

        (3) other vessels of the United States or their masters or
      crews in waters, ports, or places of the British dominions of

    proclamation under this section to any of the subjects named, and
    may include exceptions for vessels in distress or need of supplies.

      (c) Penalties. - A person violating a proclamation issued under
    this section shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more

    all of the foregoing named subjects, and may revoke, qualify,
    limit, and renew such proclamation from time to time as he may deem

    section" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      Subsection (c) is substituted for "Every violation of any such
    proclamation, or any part thereof, is declared illegal, and all
    vessels and goods so coming or being within the waters, ports, or
    places of the United States contrary to such proclamation shall be
    forfeited to the United States; and such forfeiture shall be
    enforced and proceeded upon in the same manner and with the same
    effect as in the case of vessels or goods whose importation or
    coming to or being in the waters or ports of the United States
    contrary to law may be enforced and proceeded upon. Every person
    who shall violate any of the provisions of this section, or such
    proclamation of the President made in pursuance hereof, shall be
    deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall
    be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment for

    Sec. 60507. Suspension of free passage through Saint Marys Falls
      Canal

-STATUTE-
      (a) Purpose. - The purpose of this section is to secure
    reciprocal advantages for the citizens, ports, and vessels of the
    United States.
      (b) General Authority. - When the President is satisfied that
    vessels of the United States, or passengers or cargo being
    transported to a port of the United States, are prohibited from
    passing through a canal or lock connected with the navigation of
    the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or their connecting
    waterways, or burdened in that passage by tolls or other means that
    are unreasonable in view of the free passage through the Saint
    Marys Falls Canal allowed to vessels of all countries, the
    President by proclamation may suspend the right of free passage
    through the Saint Marys Falls Canal for vessels owned by subjects
    of the country imposing the prohibition, tolls, or other burdens
    and for passengers and cargo being transported to the ports of that
    country, even when carried in vessels of the United States. The
    suspension shall apply to the extent and for the time the President
    considers appropriate.
      (c) Imposition of Toll. - 
        (1) In general. - During a suspension under this section, the
      President shall impose a toll of not more than $2 per ton on
      cargo and not more than $5 on each passenger.
        (2) Exceptions. - Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a toll may not
      be imposed on passengers or cargo landed at Ogdensburg, New York,
      or any port west of Ogdensburg and south of a line drawn from the
      northern boundary of New York through the Saint Lawrence River,
      the Great Lakes, and their connecting channels to the northern
      boundary of Minnesota.

      (d) Collection of Toll. - 
        (1) In general. - A toll imposed under this section shall be
      collected under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of
      Homeland Security. The Secretary may require the master of a
      vessel to provide a sworn statement of the amount and kind of
      cargo, the number of passengers, and the destination of the
      passengers and cargo.
        (2) Proof of landing. - When applicable, the Secretary also may
      require satisfactory proof that the passengers and cargo were
      landed at a port described in subsection (c)(2). Until that proof
      is provided, the Secretary may assume the passengers and cargo
      were not landed at such a port, and the amount of a toll that
      otherwise would be imposed is a lien enforceable against the
      vessel when found in the waters of the United States.

      In this section, the word "cargo" is substituted for "cargo",
    "cargoes", "portions or cargoes", "freight", and "freight of
    whatever kind or description" for consistency and to eliminate
    unnecessary words.

    reciprocal advantages for the citizens, ports, and vessels of the
    United States" to improve the organization of the section.
      In subsection (b), the words "and so often as" are omitted as
    unnecessary. The word "burdened" is substituted for "made difficult
    or burdensome", the word "unreasonable" is substituted for
    "reciprocally unjust and unreasonable", the words "the President by
    proclamation may suspend" are substituted for "he shall have the
    power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend by proclamation to that
    effect", the words "even when carried in vessels of the United
    States" are substituted for "whether carried in vessels of the
    United States or of other nations", and the words "The suspension
    shall apply to the extent and for the time the President considers
    appropriate" are substituted for "for such time and to such extent
    (including absolute prohibition) as he shall deem just", to

    "carried to and landed" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      In subsection (d), the Secretary of Homeland Security is

    relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland
    Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002
    (Pub. L. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the
    Commissioner of Customs previously were vested in the Secretary of
    the Treasury under section 321(c) of title 31. For prior related
    transfers of functions, see the transfer of functions note under 46
    App. U.S.C. 145.
      In subsection (d)(2), the words "a port described in subsection
    (c)(2) of this section" are substituted for "some port or place

          enforcing Coast Guard-imposed security zones around vessels
          transiting to, through, or from United States ports or in
          conducting port security patrols in United States ports (or
          both) can deter to the maximum extent practicable a
          transportation security incident;
            "(iv) the extent to which the Coast Guard has assessed the
          ability of State and local law enforcement entities to carry
          out the security assignments that they have been engaged to
          perform, including their ability to meet any national
          standards for training, equipment, and resources that have
          been established by the Coast Guard in order to ensure that
          those entities can deter to the maximum extent practicable a
          transportation security incident;
            "(v) the extent to which State and local law enforcement
          entities are able to meet national standards for training,
          equipment, and resources established by the Coast Guard to
          ensure that those entities can deter to the maximum extent
          practicable a transportation security incident;
            "(vi) the differences in law enforcement authority, and
          particularly boarding authority, between the Coast Guard and
          State and local law enforcement entities, and the impact that
          these differences have on the ability of State and local law
          enforcement entities to provide the same level of security
          that the Coast Guard provides during the enforcement of Coast
          Guard-imposed security zones and the conduct of security
          patrols in United States ports; and
            "(vii) the extent of resource, training, and equipment
          differences between State and local law enforcement entities
          and the Coast Guard units engaged in enforcing Coast Guard-
          imposed security zones around vessels transiting to,
          through, or from United States ports or conducting security
          patrols in United States ports;
          "(C) recommendations for risk-based security measures to
        improve waterside security of vessels carrying, and waterfront
        facilities handling, especially hazardous cargo; and
          "(D) identification of security funding alternatives,
        including an analysis of the potential for cost-sharing by the
        public and private sectors as well as any challenges associated
        with such cost-sharing.
        "(3) Information protection. - In carrying out the coordination
      necessary to effectively complete the study, the Commandant shall
      implement measures to ensure the protection of any sensitive
      security information, proprietary information, or classified
      information collected, reviewed, or shared during collaborative
      engagement with maritime stakeholders and other Government
      entities, except that nothing in this paragraph shall constitute
      authority to withhold information from - 
          "(A) the Congress; or
          "(B) first responders requiring such information for the
        protection of life or property.
        "(4) Report. - Not later than 12 months after the date of

        "(1) In general. - As soon as practicable but not later than
      180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 17,
      2004], the Secretary of Homeland Security shall - 
          "(A) implement a procedure under which the Department of
        Homeland Security compares information about passengers and
        crew who are to be carried aboard a cruise ship with a
        comprehensive, consolidated database containing information
        about known or suspected terrorists and their associates;
          "(B) use the information obtained by comparing the passenger
        and crew information with the information in the database to
        prevent known or suspected terrorists and their associates from
        boarding such ships or to subject them to specific additional
        security scrutiny, through the use of 'no transport' and
        'automatic selectee' lists or other means.
        "(2) Waiver. - The Secretary may waive the requirement in
      paragraph (1)(B) with respect to cruise ships embarking at
      foreign ports if the Secretary determines that the application of
      such requirement to such cruise ships is impracticable.
      "(b) Cooperation From Operators of Cruise Ships. - The Secretary
    of Homeland Security shall by rulemaking require operators of
    cruise ships to provide the passenger and crew information
    necessary to implement the procedure required by subsection (a).
      "(c) Maintenance of Accuracy and Integrity of 'No Transport' and
    'Automatic Selectee' Lists. - 
        "(1) Watch list database. - The Secretary of Homeland Security,
      in consultation with the Terrorist Screening Center, shall
      develop guidelines, policies, and operating procedures for the
      collection, removal, and updating of data maintained, or to be
      maintained, in the 'no transport' and 'automatic selectee' lists
      described in subsection (a)(1) that are designed to ensure the
      accuracy and integrity of the lists.
        "(2) Accuracy of entries. - In developing the 'no transport'
      and 'automatic selectee' lists under subsection (a)(1)(B), the
      Secretary shall establish a simple and timely method for
      correcting erroneous entries, for clarifying information known to
      cause false hits or misidentification errors, and for updating
      relevant information that is dispositive in the passenger and
      crew screening process. The Secretary shall also establish a
      process to provide an individual whose name is confused with, or
      similar to, a name in the watch list database with a means of
      demonstrating that such individual is not the person named in the
      database.
      "(d) Cruise Ship Defined. - In this section, the term 'cruise
    ship' means a vessel on an international voyage that embarks or
    disembarks passengers at a port of United States jurisdiction to

      Pub. L. 108-293, title VIII, Sec. 809(g)-(i), (k), Aug. 9, 2004,
    118 Stat. 1087, 1088, provided that:
      "(g) Evaluation of Cargo Inspection Targeting System for
    International Intermodal Cargo Containers. - Within 180 days after
    the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 9, 2004] and annually
    thereafter, the Inspector General of the department in which the
    Coast Guard is operating shall prepare a report that includes an
    assessment of - 
        "(1) the effectiveness of the current tracking system to
      determine whether it is adequate to prevent international
      intermodal containers from being used for purposes of terrorism;
        "(2) the sources of information, and the quality of the
      information at the time of reporting, used by the system to
      determine whether targeting information is collected from the
      best and most credible sources and evaluate data sources to
      determine information gaps and weaknesses;
        "(3) the targeting system for reporting and analyzing
      inspection statistics, as well as testing effectiveness;
        "(4) the competence and training of employees operating the
      system to determine whether they are sufficiently capable to
      detect potential terrorist threats; and
        "(5) whether the system is an effective system to detect
      potential acts of terrorism and whether additional steps need to
      be taken in order to remedy deficiencies in targeting
      international intermodal containers for inspection.
      "(h) Action Report. - If the Inspector General of the department
    in which the Coast Guard is operating determines in any of the
    reports prepared under subsection (g) that the targeting system is
    insufficiently effective as a means of detecting potential acts of
    terrorism utilizing international intermodal containers, then the
    Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating
    shall, within 90 days, submit a report to the Committee on
    Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the
    Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure [of the] House of
    Representatives on what actions will be taken to correct
    deficiencies identified in the Inspector General Report.
      "(i) Compliance With Security Standards Established Pursuant to
    Maritime Transportation Security Plans. - Within 180 days after the
    date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 9, 2004] and annually
    thereafter, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast

                                 FINDINGS                             
      Pub. L. 107-295, title I, Sec. 101, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat.
    2066, provided that:
      "The Congress makes the following findings:
        "(1) There are 361 public ports in the United States that are
      an integral part of our Nation's commerce.
        "(2) United States ports handle over 95 percent of United
      States overseas trade. The total volume of goods imported and
      exported through ports is expected to more than double over the
      next 20 years.
        "(3) The variety of trade and commerce carried out at ports
      includes bulk cargo, containerized cargo, passenger transport and
      tourism, and intermodal transportation systems that are complex
      to secure.
        "(4) The United States is increasingly dependent on imported
      energy for a substantial share of its energy supply, and a
      disruption of that share of supply would seriously harm consumers
      and our economy.
        "(5) The top 50 ports in the United States account for about 90
      percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United States ports
      account for 98 percent of all container shipments. Cruise ships
      visiting foreign destinations embark from at least 16 ports.
      Ferries in the United States transport 113,000,000 passengers and
      32,000,000 vehicles per year.
        "(6) Ports often are a major locus of Federal crime, including
      drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of contraband and
      aliens.
        "(7) Ports are often very open and exposed and are susceptible
      to large scale acts of terrorism that could cause a large loss of
      life or economic disruption.
        "(8) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are
      insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology is
      currently not adequately deployed to allow for the nonintrusive
      inspection of containerized cargo.
        "(9) The cruise ship industry poses a special risk from a
      security perspective.
        "(10) Securing entry points and other areas of port facilities
      and examining or inspecting containers would increase security at
      United States ports.
        "(11) Biometric identification procedures for individuals
      having access to secure areas in port facilities are important
      tools to deter and prevent port cargo crimes, smuggling, and
      terrorist actions.
        "(12) United States ports are international boundaries that - 
          "(A) are particularly vulnerable to breaches in security;
          "(B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the United
        States to realize its national security objectives; and
          "(C) may serve as a vector or target for terrorist attacks
        aimed at the United States.
        "(13) It is in the best interests of the United States - 
          "(A) to have a free flow of interstate and foreign commerce
        and to ensure the efficient movement of cargo;
          "(B) to increase United States port security by establishing
        improving communication among law enforcement officials
        responsible for port security;
          "(C) to formulate requirements for physical port security,
        recognizing the different character and nature of United States
        port facilities, and to require the establishment of security
        programs at port facilities;
          "(D) to provide financial assistance to help the States and
        the private sector to increase physical security of United
        States ports;
          "(E) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate the
        private sector development of technology that will assist in
        the nonintrusive timely detection of crime or potential crime
        at United States ports;
          "(F) to increase intelligence collection on cargo and
        intermodal movements to address areas of potential threat to
        safety and security; and
          "(G) to promote private sector procedures that provide for in-
        transit visibility and support law enforcement efforts
        directed at managing the security risks of cargo shipments.
        "(14) On April 27, 1999, the President established the
      Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States
      Ports to undertake a comprehensive study of the nature and extent
      of the problem of crime in our ports, as well as the ways in
      which governments at all levels are responding. The Commission
      concluded that frequent crimes in ports include drug smuggling,
      illegal car exports, fraud, and cargo theft. Internal
      conspiracies are an issue at many ports and contribute to Federal
      crime. Criminal organizations are exploiting weak security at
      ports to commit a wide range of cargo crimes. Intelligence and
      information sharing among law enforcement agencies needs to be
      improved and coordinated at many ports. A lack of minimum
      physical and personnel security standards at ports and related
      facilities leaves many ports and port users very vulnerable.
      Access to ports and operations within ports is often
      uncontrolled. Security-related and detection-related equipment,
      such as small boats, cameras, large-scale x-ray machines, and
      vessel tracking devices, are lacking at many ports.
        "(15) The International Maritime Organization and other similar
      international organizations are currently developing a new
      maritime security system that contains the essential elements for
      enhancing global maritime security. Therefore, it is in the best
      interests of the United States to implement new international
      instruments that establish such a system."

      courses and certified personnel at United States and foreign
      ports used by United States-flagged vessels, or by foreign-
      flagged vessels with United States citizens as passengers or
      crewmembers, to develop and enhance security awareness and
      practices.
      "(c) Training Provided to Law Enforcement and Security Personnel.
    - 
        "(1) In general. - The Secretary is authorized to make the
      training opportunities provided under this section available to
      any Federal, State, local, and private law enforcement or
      maritime security personnel in the United States or to personnel
      employed in foreign ports used by vessels with United States

        judge. -

          information may be submitted by the Secretary to the

          security procedures, and shall be reviewed by the
          administrative law judge ex parte and in camera.
            (ii) Security clearances. - Pursuant to existing procedures
          and requirements, the Secretary, in coordination (as
          necessary) with the heads of other affected departments or
          agencies, shall ensure that administrative law judges
          reviewing negative waiver decisions of the Secretary under
          this paragraph possess security clearances appropriate for
          such review.
            (iii) Unclassified summaries of classified evidence. - As
          part of a review conducted under this paragraph and upon the
          request of the individual adversely affected by the decision
          of the Secretary not to grant a waiver, the Secretary shall
          provide to the individual and reviewing administrative law
          judge, consistent with the procedures established under
          clause (i), an unclassified summary of any classified
          information upon which the decision of the Secretary was
          based.

          (E) New evidence. - The Secretary shall establish a process
        under which an individual may submit a new request for a
        waiver, notwithstanding confirmation by the administrative law
        judge of the Secretary's initial denial of the waiver, if the
        request is supported by substantial evidence that was not
        available to the Secretary at the time the initial waiver
        request was denied.

        (4) The Secretary shall establish an appeals process under this
      section for individuals found to be ineligible for a
      transportation security card that includes notice and an
      opportunity for a hearing.
        (5) Upon application, the Secretary may issue a transportation
      security card to an individual if the Secretary has previously

      does not pose a security risk.

      (d) Background Records Check. - (1) On request of the Secretary,
    the Attorney General shall - 
        (A) conduct a background records check regarding the
      individual; and

      (2) Any information constituting grounds for denial of a
    transportation security card under this section shall be maintained
    confidentially by the Secretary and may be used only for making

    individual's employer may only be informed of whether or not the
    individual has been issued the card under this section.
      (f) Definition. - In this section, the term "alien" has the
    meaning given the term in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Unless the Secretary finds that a foreign port
    or facility maintains effective antiterrorism measures, the
    Secretary - 
        (1) may prescribe conditions of entry into the United States
      for any vessel arriving from that port or facility, or any vessel
      carrying cargo or passengers originating from or transshipped
      through that port or facility;

      under section 70109 unless the Secretary finds that the
      government has brought the antiterrorism measures at the port or
      facility up to the security level the Secretary used in making an
      assessment under section 70108 before the end of that 90-day
      period; or
        (2) immediately upon the finding of the Secretary under
      subsection (a) if the Secretary finds, after consulting with the
      Secretary of State, that a condition exists that threatens the
      safety or security of passengers, vessels, or crew traveling to
      or from the port or facility.

      (c) State Department To Be Notified. - The Secretary immediately
    shall notify the Secretary of State of a finding that a port or
    facility does not maintain effective antiterrorism measures.
      (d) Action Canceled. - An action required under this section is

        (1) In general. - The Secretary, in consultation with the
      Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of State, and the
      Secretary of Energy, shall identify assistance programs that
      could facilitate implementation of port or facility security
      antiterrorism measures in foreign countries and territories of
      the United States. The Secretary shall establish a strategic plan
      to utilize those assistance programs to assist ports and
      facilities that are found by the Secretary under subsection (a)
      not to maintain effective antiterrorism measures in the
      implementation of port or facility security antiterrorism
      measures.

      place particular emphasis on utilizing programs to facilitate the
      implementation of port or facility security antiterrorism
      measures at the ports located in the Caribbean Basin, as such
      ports pose unique security and safety threats to the United
      States due to - 
          (A) the strategic location of such ports between South
        America and the United States;
          (B) the relative openness of such ports; and
          (C) the significant number of shipments of narcotics to the
        United States that are moved through such ports.

      (f) Coast Guard Assistance Program. - 
        (1) In general. - The Secretary may lend, lease, donate, or
      otherwise provide equipment, and provide technical training and
      support, to the owner or operator of a foreign port or facility -
      
          (A) to assist in bringing the port or facility into
        compliance with applicable International Ship and Port Facility
        Code standards; and
          (B) to assist the port or facility in correcting deficiencies
        identified in periodic port assessments and reassessments
        required under section 70108 of this title.

        (2) Conditions. - The Secretary - 
          (A) may provide such assistance based upon an assessment of
        the risks to the security of the United States and the
        inability of the owner or operator of the port or facility to
        bring the port or facility into compliance with those standards
        and to maintain compliance with, or exceed, such standards;
          (B) may not provide such assistance unless the port or
        facility has been subjected to a comprehensive port security
        assessment by the Coast Guard; and
          (C) may only lend, lease, or otherwise provide equipment that
        the Secretary has first determined is not required by the Coast
        Guard for the performance of its missions.

      In paragraph (2), the term "vessel of the United States" is
    omitted because the definition of that term in 46 U.S.C. 2101 is
    being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title and will apply
    generally throughout the title.
      In paragraph (3), the definition of "Secretary" is new. The
    functions of the Secretary of Transportation under this chapter
    were carried out by the Coast Guard, and its functions have been
    transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (except when
    operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland

-STATUTE-
      Congress encourages the President to continue to seek agreement
    on international seaport and vessel security through the
    International Maritime Organization. In developing an agreement,
    each member country of the International Maritime Organization
    should consult with appropriate private sector interests in that
    country. The agreement would establish seaport and vessel security
    measures and could include - 
        (1) seaport screening of cargo and baggage similar to that done
      at airports;
        (2) security measures to restrict access to cargo, vessels, and
      dockside property to authorized personnel only;
        (3) additional security on board vessels;
        (4) licensing or certification of compliance with appropriate
      security standards; and
        (5) other appropriate measures to prevent unlawful acts against
      passengers and crews on vessels.

        (1) notify the appropriate government authorities of the
      country in which the port is located of the determination; and

      that port up to the standard used by the Secretary in making the
      assessment under subsection (a).

      (c) Antiterrorism Assistance. - The President is encouraged to
    provide antiterrorism assistance related to maritime security under
    chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22

    Sec. 70305. Suspension of passenger services

-STATUTE-
      (a) General Authority. - Whenever the President determines that a
    foreign nation permits the use of territory under its jurisdiction
    as a base of operations or training for, or as a sanctuary for, or
    in any way arms, aids, or abets, a terrorist or terrorist group
    that knowingly uses the illegal seizure of passenger vessels or the
    threat thereof as an instrument of policy, the President may
    suspend the right of any passenger vessel common carrier to operate
    to or from, and the right of any passenger vessel of the United
    States to use, a port in that foreign nation for passenger service.
    The suspension may be without notice or hearing and for as long as
    the President determines is necessary to ensure the security of
    passenger vessels against unlawful seizure.
      (b) Prohibition. - A passenger vessel common carrier, or a
    passenger vessel of the United States, may not operate in violation
    of a suspension under this section.
      (c) Penalties. - 
        (1) Denial of entry. - If a person operates a vessel in
      violation of this section, the Secretary may deny the vessels of
      that person entry to ports of the United States.
        (2) Civil penalty. - A person violating this section is liable
      to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more
      than $50,000. Each day a vessel uses a prohibited port is a
      separate violation.

-STATUTE-
      Congress finds and declares that (1) trafficking in controlled
    substances aboard vessels is a serious international problem, is
    universally condemned, and presents a specific threat to the
    security and societal well-being of the United States and (2)
    operating or embarking in a submersible vessel or semi-submersible
    vessel without nationality and on an international voyage is a
    serious international problem, facilitates transnational crime,
    including drug trafficking, and terrorism, and presents a specific
    threat to the safety of maritime navigation and the security of the
    United States.

      In subsection (b)(2), before subparagraph (A), the words
    "individual who is a citizen of the United States" are substituted
    for "a citizen or national of the United States" because of the
    definition of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the
    revised title. The words "or a territory, commonwealth, or
    possession of the United States" and "the District of Columbia, or
    any territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States"
    are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "State" in
    chapter 1 of the revised title.
      In subsection (b)(3), the words "placed under foreign registry,
    or operated under the authority of a foreign nation" are
    substituted for "placed under foreign registry or foreign flag"
    because of the definition of "foreign vessel" in chapter 1 of the
    revised title.
      In subsection (d)(1)(B), the word "authorized" is substituted for
    "empowered" for consistency with subsection (b)(2)(B).

          (B) a public vessel of the United States or an individual on
        board the vessel who possesses or distributes a controlled
        substance in the lawful course of the individual's duties.

        (2) Entered in manifest. - Paragraph (1) applies only if the
      controlled substance is part of the cargo entered in the vessel's
      manifest and is intended to be imported lawfully into the country
      of destination for scientific, medical, or other lawful purposes.

      (d) Burden of Proof. - The United States Government is not
    required to negative a defense provided by subsection (c) in a
    complaint, information, indictment, or other pleading or in a trial
    or other proceeding. The burden of going forward with the evidence
    supporting the defense is on the person claiming its benefit.

    Sec. 70505. Failure to comply with international law as a defense

-STATUTE-
      A person charged with violating section 70503 of this title, or
    against whom a civil enforcement proceeding is brought under
    section 70508, does not have standing to raise a claim of failure
    to comply with international law as a basis for a defense. A claim
    of failure to comply with international law in the enforcement of
    this chapter may be made only by a foreign nation. A failure to
    comply with international law does not divest a court of
    jurisdiction and is not a defense to a proceeding under this
    chapter.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Violations. - A person violating section 70503 of this title
    shall be punished as provided in section 1010 of the Comprehensive
    Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 960).
    However, if the offense is a second or subsequent offense as
    provided in section 1012(b) of that Act (21 U.S.C. 962(b)), the
    person shall be punished as provided in section 1012 of that Act
    (21 U.S.C. 962).
      (b) Attempts and Conspiracies. - A person attempting or
    conspiring to violate section 70503 of this title is subject to the
    same penalties as provided for violating section 70503.
      (c) Simple Possession. - 
        (1) In general. - Any individual on a vessel subject to the
      jurisdiction of the United States who is found by the Secretary,
      after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, to have knowingly
      or intentionally possessed a controlled substance within the
      meaning of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) shall be
      liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not to exceed
      $5,000 for each violation. The Secretary shall notify the
      individual in writing of the amount of the civil penalty.
        (2) Determination of amount. - In determining the amount of the
      penalty, the Secretary shall consider the nature, circumstances,
      extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with
      respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history
      of prior offenses, ability to pay, and other matters that justice
      requires.
        (3) Treatment of civil penalty assessment. - Assessment of a
      civil penalty under this subsection shall not be considered a
      conviction for purposes of State or Federal law but may be
      considered proof of possession if such a determination is
      relevant.

    Sec. 70507. Forfeitures

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - Property described in section 511(a) of the
    Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21
    U.S.C. 881(a)) that is used or intended for use to commit, or to
    facilitate the commission of, an offense under section 70503 of
    this title may be seized and forfeited in the same manner that
    similar property may be seized and forfeited under section 511 of
    that Act (21 U.S.C. 881).
      (b) Prima Facie Evidence of Violation. - Practices commonly
    recognized as smuggling tactics may provide prima facie evidence of
    intent to use a vessel to commit, or to facilitate the commission
    of, an offense under section 70503 of this title, and may support
    seizure and forfeiture of the vessel, even in the absence of
    controlled substances aboard the vessel. The following indicia,
    among others, may be considered, in the totality of the
    circumstances, to be prima facie evidence that a vessel is intended
    to be used to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such an
    offense:
        (1) The construction or adaptation of the vessel in a manner
      that facilitates smuggling, including - 
          (A) the configuration of the vessel to ride low in the water
        or present a low hull profile to avoid being detected visually
        or by radar;
          (B) the presence of any compartment or equipment that is
        built or fitted out for smuggling, not including items such as
        a safe or lock-box reasonably used for the storage of personal
        valuables;
          (C) the presence of an auxiliary tank not installed in
        accordance with applicable law or installed in such a manner as
        to enhance the vessel's smuggling capability;
          (D) the presence of engines that are excessively over-powered
        in relation to the design and size of the vessel;
          (E) the presence of materials used to reduce or alter the
        heat or radar signature of the vessel and avoid detection;
          (F) the presence of a camouflaging paint scheme, or of
        materials used to camouflage the vessel, to avoid detection; or
          (G) the display of false vessel registration numbers, false
        indicia of vessel nationality, false vessel name, or false
        vessel homeport.

        (2) The presence or absence of equipment, personnel, or cargo
      inconsistent with the type or declared purpose of the vessel.
        (3) The presence of excessive fuel, lube oil, food, water, or
      spare parts, inconsistent with legitimate vessel operation,
      inconsistent with the construction or equipment of the vessel, or
      inconsistent with the character of the vessel's stated purpose.
        (4) The operation of the vessel without lights during times
      lights are required to be displayed under applicable law or
      regulation and in a manner of navigation consistent with
      smuggling tactics used to avoid detection by law enforcement
      authorities.
        (5) The failure of the vessel to stop or respond or heave to
      when hailed by government authority, especially where the vessel
      conducts evasive maneuvering when hailed.
        (6) The declaration to government authority of apparently false
      information about the vessel, crew, or voyage or the failure to
      identify the vessel by name or country of registration when

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prohibition. - Except as provided in this section or section
    80105 of this title, a foreign vessel may not, under penalty of

    States on the Gulf of Mexico.
      (b) When Suitable Vessel Not Available. - The Secretary of
    Homeland Security may authorize a foreign vessel to engage in
    salvaging operations in a particular locality if, on investigation,
    the Secretary is satisfied that there is not available in that
    locality a suitable vessel that is - 
        (1) owned only by citizens of the United States (including a

      In subsection (a), the words "authorized by a treaty" are omitted

      In subsection (b), before paragraph (1), the Secretary of

    the Treasury under section 321(c) of title 31. For prior related
    transfers of functions, see the transfer of functions note under 46
    App. U.S.C. 316. The words "and no penalty shall be incurred for
    such authorized use" are omitted as unnecessary.
      In subsection (b)(1), the words "(including a Bowaters
    corporation under section 12118 of this title)" are added because
    the source for section 12118 (46 App. U.S.C. 883-1) provides that a
    corporation meeting the requirements of that section is also a
    citizen of the United States under 46 App. U.S.C. 316, restated in
    part in this section.
      Subsection (b)(2) is substituted for "documented under the laws
    of the United States or numbered pursuant to the Act of June 7,
    1918, as amended (46 U.S.C. 288)" to refer to the current
    provisions on documentation and numbering.
      In subsection (c), the words "authorized by treaty, including"
    are added because the words "authorized by a treaty" are omitted
    from subsection (a).

      In the definition of "international transport", subparagraphs (A)
    and (B) are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1501(d)(1)-(3) to
    eliminate unnecessary words.
      In the definition of "owner", the words "includes the lessee or
    bailee of a container if a written lease or bailment provides for
    the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for
    maintaining and examining the container" are substituted for "means
    a person who owns a container, or, if a written lease or bailment
    provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's
    responsibility for maintaining and examining the container, the
    lessee or bailee of a container, to the extent such agreement so
    provides" to eliminate unnecessary words.
      The definition of "Secretary" is omitted because a complete
    reference to the appropriate Secretary is used the first time the
    Secretary is named in each section. Throughout this chapter, the
    phrase "Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is
    operating" is substituted for "Secretary of Transportation" because
    the Coast Guard has been transferred to the Department of Homeland
    Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by
    section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296,
    116 Stat. 2249).
      The definition of "United States" is omitted because "United
    States" is defined in chapter 1 of the revised title. The
    definitions of "new container" and "existing container" are omitted
    as obsolete.

    chapter in the United States.
      (b) Regulations. - The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to
    carry out this chapter. The regulations shall - 
        (1) establish procedures for testing, inspecting, and initially
      approving containers and designs for containers, including
      procedures for attaching, invalidating, and removing safety
      approval plates for containers;
        (2) establish procedures to be followed by the owners of
      containers for the periodic examination of containers as provided
      in the Convention; and
        (3) provide a method for developing, collecting, and
      disseminating information about container safety and the
      international transport of containers.

      (c) Safety Approval Plates. - If the owner of a container without
    a safety approval plate establishes that the container satisfies
    the standards of the Convention, the Secretary may authorize a
    safety approval plate to be attached to the container.
      (d) Schedule of Fees. - The Secretary may prescribe a schedule of
    fees for services performed by the Secretary, or by a person
    delegated authority under section 80506 of this title, for the
    testing, inspection, and initial approval of containers and
    container designs.
      (e) Encouraging Intermodal Transport. - To the maximum extent

-STATUTE-
      (a) In General. - To enforce the Convention, this chapter, and
    regulations prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary of the
    department in which the Coast Guard is operating may - 
        (1) examine, or require to be examined, containers in
      international transport;
        (2) approve designs for containers;
        (3) inspect and test containers being manufactured;
        (4) issue a detention order removing or excluding a container
      from service until the container owner satisfies the Secretary
      that the container meets the standards of the Convention, if the
      container - 
          (A) does not have a safety approval plate attached to it; or
          (B) has a safety approval plate attached but there is
        significant evidence that the container is in a condition that
        creates an obvious risk to safety;

        (5) take other appropriate action, including issuing necessary
      orders, to remove a container from service or restrict its use if
      the container is not in compliance with the Convention, this
      chapter, or regulations prescribed under this chapter, but does
      not present an obvious risk to safety; and
        (6) allow a container found to be unsafe or without a safety
      approval plate to be moved to another location for repair or
      other disposition, under restrictions consistent with the intent
      of the Convention.

      (b) Payment of Expenses. - 
        (1) Examination. - The owner of a container involved in an
      action by the Secretary under this section related to an
      examination of the container shall pay or reimburse the Secretary
      for the expenses arising from that action, except for the costs
      of routine examinations of the container or a safety approval
      plate.
        (2) Testing, inspection, and initial approval. - The owner of a
      container submitted to the procedure established by the Secretary
      for testing, inspection, and initial approval, and the
      manufacturer of a container that submits a design to the
      procedure established by the Secretary for testing, inspection,
      and initial approval, shall pay or reimburse the Secretary for
      the expenses arising from the testing, inspection, or approval.
        (3) Credit to appropriation. - Amounts received by the
      Secretary as reimbursement shall be credited to the appropriation
      for operating expenses of the Coast Guard.

      (c) Presumption Based on Safety Approval Plate. - A container
    bearing a safety approval plate authorized by a country that is a
    party to the Convention is presumed to be in a safe condition
    unless there is significant evidence that the container is in a
    condition that creates an obvious risk to safety.
      (d) Notice of Orders. - 
        (1) In general. - When the Secretary issues a detention or
      other order under this section, the Secretary promptly shall
      notify in writing - 
          (A) the owner of the container;
          (B) the owner's agent; or
          (C) if the identity of the owner is not apparent from the
        container or shipping documents, the custodian.

        (2) Information to include. - The notification shall identify
      the container involved, give the location of the container, and
      describe the condition or situation giving rise to the order.

      (e) Duration of Orders. - An order issued by the Secretary under
    this section remains in effect until - 
        (1) the Secretary declares the container to be in compliance
      with the standards of the Convention; or
        (2) the container is removed permanently from service.

      (f) Notice of Defective Container to Country Issuing Safety
    Approval Plate. - If the Secretary has reason to believe that a
    container bearing a safety approval plate issued by another country
    was defective at the time of approval, the Secretary shall notify
    that country.
