    audited, and settled, and checks signed in the name of the former
    disbursing officer by a deputy disbursing officer shall be honored
    in the same manner as if the former disbursing officer had
    continued in office.
      (2) A former disbursing officer of the Government Printing Office
    or his estate may not be subject to any legal liability or penalty
    for the official accounts or defaults of the deputy disbursing
    officer acting in the name or in the place of the former disbursing
    officer. Each deputy disbursing officer is responsible for accounts
    entrusted to him under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and the
    deputy disbursing officer is liable for any default occurring
    during his service under such paragraph.
      (c)(1) The Public Printer may designate in writing officers and
    employees of the Government Printing Office to certify vouchers for
    payment from appropriations and funds. Such officers and employees
    shall (A) be responsible for the existence and correctness of the
    facts recited in the certificate or other voucher or its supporting
    papers and for the legality of the proposed payment under the
    appropriation or fund involved, (B) be responsible and accountable
    for the correctness of the computations of certified vouchers, and
    (C) be accountable for, and required to make restitution to, the
    United States for the amount of any illegal, improper, or incorrect
    payment resulting from any false, inaccurate, or misleading
    certificate made by him, as well as for any payment prohibited by
    law or which did not represent a legal obligation under the
    appropriation or fund involved. However, the Comptroller General of
    the United States, may, at his discretion, relieve such certifying
    officer or employee of liability for any payment otherwise proper
    whenever he finds that (i) the certification was based on the
    official records and that such certifying officer or employee did
    not know, and by reasonable diligence and inquiry could not have
    ascertained, the actual facts, or (ii) when the obligation was
    incurred in good faith, the payment was not contrary to any
    statutory provision specifically prohibiting payments of the
    character involved, and the United States has received value for
    such payment. The Comptroller General shall relieve such certifying
    officer or employee of liability for an overpayment for
    transportation services made to any common carrier covered by
    section 3726 of title 31, whenever he finds that the overpayment
    occurred solely because the administrative examination made prior
    to payment of the transportation bill did not include a
    verification of transportation rates, freight classifications, or
    land grant deductions.
      (2) The liability of such certifying officers or employees shall
    be enforced in the same manner and to the same extent as provided
    by law with respect to the enforcement of the liability of
    disbursing and other accountable officers. Such certifying officers
    and employees shall have the right to apply for and obtain a
    decision by the Comptroller General on any question of law involved
    in a payment on any vouchers presented to them for certification.

      "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
      "This Act may be cited as the 'Vegetable Ink Printing Act of
    1994'."

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) More than 95 percent of Federal printing involving
      documents or publications is performed using lithographic inks.
        "(2) Various types of oil, including petroleum and vegetable
      oil, are used in lithographic ink.
        "(3) Increasing the amount of vegetable oil used in a
      lithographic ink would - 
          "(A) help reduce the Nation's use of nonrenewable energy
        resources;
          "(B) result in the use of products that are less damaging to
        the environment;
          "(C) result in a reduction of volatile organic compound
        emissions; and
          "(D) increase the use of renewable agricultural products.
        "(4) The technology exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic
      ink and, in some applications, to use lithographic ink that uses
      no petroleum distillates in the liquid portion of the ink.
        "(5) Some lithographic inks have contained vegetable oils for
      many years; other lithographic inks have more recently begun to
      use vegetable oil.
        "(6) According to the Government Printing Office, using
      vegetable oil-based ink appears to add little if any additional
      cost to Government printing.
        "(7) Use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government
      printing should further develop - 
          "(A) the commercial viability of vegetable oil-based ink,
        which could result in demand, for domestic use alone, for
        2,500,000,000 pounds of vegetable crops or 500,000,000 pounds
        of vegetable oil; and
          "(B) a product that could help the United States retain or
        enlarge its share of the world market for vegetable oil-ink.
      "(b) Purpose. - The purpose of this Act is to require that all
    lithographic printing using ink containing oil that is performed or
    procured by a Federal agency shall use ink containing the maximum
    amounts of vegetable oil and materials derived from other renewable
    resources that - 
        "(1) are technologically feasible, and
        "(2) result in printing costs that are competitive with
      printing using petroleum-based inks.

      "SEC. 3. FEDERAL PRINTING REQUIREMENTS.
      "(a) General Rule. - Notwithstanding any other law, and except as
    provided in subsection (b), a Federal agency may not perform or
    procure lithographic printing that uses ink containing oil if the
    ink contains less than the following percentage of vegetable oil:
        "(1) In the case of news ink, 40 percent.
        "(2) In the case of sheet-fed ink, 20 percent.
        "(3) In the case of forms ink, 20 percent.
        "(4) In the case of heat-set ink, 10 percent.
      "(b) Exceptions. - 
        "(1) Exceptions. - Subsection (a) shall not apply to
      lithographic printing performed or procured by a Federal agency,
      if - 
          "(A) the head of the agency determines, after consultation
        with the Public Printer and within the 3-year period ending on
        the date of the commencement of the printing or the date of
        that procurement, respectively, that vegetable oil-based ink is
        not suitable to meet specific, identified requirements of the
        agency related to the printing; or
          "(B) the Public Printer determines - 
            "(i) within the 3-month period ending on the date of the
          commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of
          materials that are printed at intervals of less than 6
          months, or
            "(ii) before the date of the commencement of the printing,
          in the case of printing of materials that are printed at
          intervals of 6 months or more;
      that the cost of performing the printing using vegetable oil-
      based ink is significantly greater than the cost of performing
      the printing using other available ink.
        "(2) Notice to congress. - Not later than 30 days after making
      a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the head of a Federal
      agency shall report the determination to the Committee on
      Government Operations [now Committee on Oversight and Government
      Reform] and the Committee on House Administration of the House of
      Representatives, and the Committee on Rules of the Senate.
      "(c) Federal Agency Defined. - In this Act, the term 'Federal
    agency' means - 
        "(1) an executive department, military department, Government
      corporation, Government-controlled corporation, or other
      establishment in the executive branch of the Government
      (including the Executive Office of the President), or any
      independent regulatory agency; and
        "(2) an establishment or component of the legislative or
      judicial branch of the Government."

    "Whereas it is now widely recognized and scientifically
      demonstrated that the acidic papers commonly used for more than a
      century in documents, books, and other publications are self-
      destructing and will continue to self destruct;
    "Whereas Americans are facing the prospect of continuing to lose
      national, historical, scientific, and scholarly records,
      including government records, faster than salvage efforts can be
      mounted despite the dedicated efforts of many libraries,
      archives, and agencies, such as the Library of Congress and the

    "Whereas nationwide hundreds of millions of dollars will have to be
      spent by the Federal, State, and local governments and private
      institutions to salvage the most essential books and other
      materials in the libraries and archives of government, academic,
      and private institutions;
    "Whereas paper manufacturers can produce a sufficient supply of
      acid free permanent papers with a life of several hundred years,
      at prices competitive with acid papers, if publishers would
      specify the use of such papers, and some publishers and many
      university presses are already publishing on acid free permanent

      urged the use of acid free permanent papers;
    "Whereas even when books are printed on acid free permanent paper
      this fact is often not made known to libraries by notations in
      the book or by notations in standard bibliographic listings; and
    "Whereas there is an urgent need to prevent the continuance of the
      acid paper problem in the future: Now, therefore, be it

    United States of America in Congress assembled,
      "Section 1. It is the policy of the United States that Federal
    records, books, and publications of enduring value be produced on
    acid free permanent papers.
      "Sec. 2. The Congress of the United States urgently recommends
    that - 
        "(1) Federal agencies require the use of acid free permanent
      papers for publications of enduring value produced by the
      Government Printing Office or produced by Federal grant or
      contract, using the specifications for such paper established by
      the Joint Committee on Printing;
        "(2) Federal agencies require the use of archival quality acid
      free papers for permanently valuable Federal records and confer
      with the National Archives and Records Administration on the
      requirements for paper quality;
        "(3) American publishers and State and local governments use
      acid free permanent papers for publications of enduring value, in
      voluntary compliance with the American National Standard;
        "(4) all publishers, private and governmental, prominently note
      the use of acid free permanent paper in books, advertisements,
      catalogs, and standard bibliographic listings; and
        "(5) the Secretary of State, Librarian of Congress, Archivist
      of the United States, and other Federal officials make known the
      national policy regarding acid free permanent papers to foreign
      governments and appropriate international agencies since the acid
      paper problem is worldwide and essential foreign materials being
      imported by our libraries are printed on acid papers.
      "Sec. 3. The Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United
    States, and the Public Printer shall jointly monitor the Federal
    Government's progress in implementing the national policy declared
    in section 1 regarding acid free permanent papers and shall report
    to the Congress regarding such progress on December 31, 1991,
    December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1995. In carrying out the
    monitoring and reporting functions under this section, the
    Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and the
    Public Printer may consult with the National Endowment for the
    Humanities, National Agricultural Library, National Library of

    Sec. 701. "Usual number" of documents and reports; distribution of
      House and Senate documents and reports; binding; reports on
      private bills; number of copies printed; distribution

-STATUTE-
      (a) The order by either House of Congress to print a document or
    report shall signify the "usual number" of copies for binding and
    distribution among those entitled to receive them. A greater number
    may not be printed unless ordered by either House, or as provided
    by this section. When a special number of a document or report is
    ordered printed, the usual number shall also be printed, unless
    already ordered.
      (b) The "usual number" of documents and reports shall be one
    thousand six hundred and eighty-two copies, which shall be printed
    at one time and distributed as follows:
      Of the House documents and reports, unbound - to the Senate
    document room, one hundred and fifty copies; to the office of the
    Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room,
    not to exceed five hundred copies; to the office of the Clerk of
    the House of Representatives, twenty copies; to the Library of
    Congress, ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.
      Of the Senate documents and reports, unbound - to the Senate
    document room, two hundred and twenty copies; office of the
    Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room,
    not to exceed five hundred copies; to the Clerk's office of the
    House of Representatives, ten copies; to the Library of Congress,
    ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.
      (c) Of the number printed, the Public Printer shall bind a
    sufficient number of copies for distribution as follows:
      Of the House documents and reports, bound - to the Senate
    library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, not to exceed
    one hundred and fifty copies, as provided by section 1718 of this
    title; to the House of Representatives library, fifteen copies; to
    the Superintendent of Documents, as many copies as are required for
    distribution to the State libraries and designated depositories.
      Of the Senate documents and reports, bound - to the Senate
    library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, copies as
    provided by sections 1718 and 1719 of this title; to the House of
    Representatives library, fifteen copies; to the Superintendent of
    Documents, as many copies as may be required for distribution to
    State libraries and designated depositories. In binding documents
    the Public Printer shall give precedence to those that are to be
    distributed to libraries and to designated depositories. But a
    State library or designated depository entitled to documents that
    may prefer to have its documents in unbound form, may do so by
    notifying the Superintendent of Documents to that effect prior to
    the convening of each Congress.
      (d) The usual number of reports on private bills, concurrent or
    simple resolutions, may not be printed. Instead there shall be
    printed of each Senate report on a private bill, simple or
    concurrent resolution, in addition to those required to be
    furnished the Library of Congress, three hundred and forty-five
    copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate
    document room, two hundred and twenty copies; to the Secretary of
    the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one hundred
    copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies; and of each
    House report on a private bill, simple or concurrent resolution, in
    addition to those for the Library of Congress, two hundred and
    sixty copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate
    document room, one hundred and thirty-five copies; to the Secretary
    of the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one
    hundred copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies.
      This section does not prevent the binding of all Senate and House
    reports in the reserve volumes bound for and delivered to the
    Senate and House libraries, nor abridge the right of the Vice
    President, Senators, Representatives, Resident Commissioner,
    Secretary of the Senate, and Clerk of the House to have bound in
    half morocco, or material not more expensive, one copy of every
    public document to which he may be entitled. At least twelve copies
    of each report on bills for the payment or adjudication of claims
    against the Government shall be kept on file in the Senate document
    room.

    board may not be numbered in the document or report series of
    either House of Congress, but shall be designated by title and
    bound as provided by section 738 of this title; and the
    departmental edition, if any, shall be printed concurrently with
    the "usual number." Hearings of committees may be printed as
    congressional documents only when specifically ordered by Congress
    or either House.

    the House, which is contained in the round numbers thus accredited
    to that House, so that the number delivered divides evenly and

    delivered; and the remainder of the documents thus resulting shall
    be turned over to the Superintendent of Documents, to be
    distributed by him, first, to public and school libraries for the
    purpose of completing broken sets; second, to public and school
    libraries that have not been supplied with any portions of the

    prepayment of the cost, may reprint documents and reports of
    committees together with the evidence papers submitted, or any part
    ordered printed by the Congress.
      He may also furnish without cost to Members and the Resident
    Commissioner from Puerto Rico, blank franks printed on sheets and
    perforated, or singly at their option, for public documents. Franks
    shall contain in the upper left-hand corner the following words:
    "Public document. United States Senate" or "House of
    Representatives U.S." and in the upper right-hand corner the
    letters "U.S.S." or "M. C." Franks may also contain information
    relating to missing children as provided in section 3220 of title

    desirable to affix the official title of a document. Other words
    printed on franks shall be at the personal expense of the Member or
    Resident Commissioner ordering them.
      At the request of a Member of Congress or Resident Commissioner
    the Public Printer may print upon franks or envelopes used for
    mailing public documents the facsimile signature of the Member or
    Resident Commissioner and a special request for return if not
    called for, and the name of the State or Commonwealth and county
    and city. The Member or Resident Commissioner shall deposit with
    his order the extra expense involved in printing these additional
    words.

    Resident Commissioner, print on envelopes authorized to be
    furnished, the name of the Member or Resident Commissioner, and
    State or Commonwealth, the date, and the topic or subject matter,

    Printing Office for the year in which the work is done. He shall

    CHAPTER 13 - PARTICULAR REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1307. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:
      nautical products, sale and distribution

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) All nautical products created or published by the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall be sold at such prices
    as the Secretary of Commerce shall establish annually, in
    accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The Secretary
    shall publish annually the prices at which nautical products are
    sold to the public.
      (2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the prices
    of nautical products may be increased over a period of not less
    than three years after the date of enactment of this section so as
    to recover all costs attributable to data base management,
    compilation, printing, and distribution of such products. The
    prices of such products may be maintained to recover all such costs
    thereafter.
      (B) The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of
    Transportation, shall adjust the prices of nautical products in
    such manner as is necessary to avoid any adverse impact on marine
    safety attributable to the prices specified in subparagraph (A) of
    this paragraph.
      (3) This section shall not be construed to require the
    establishment of any price for a nautical product where, in the
    judgment of the Secretary, furnishing of that product to a
    recipient is a reasonable exchange for voluntary contribution of
    information by the recipient to a program of the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration.
      (4) Prices established under this section may not include costs
    attributable to the acquisition or processing of nautical data.
      (b) Fees collected from the sale of nautical products under this
    section and from any licensing of such products which is permitted
    under any other provision of law shall be deposited in the
    miscellaneous receipts fund of the United States Treasury.
      (c) The Secretary may distribute nautical products - 
        (1) without charge to each foreign government or international
      organization with which the Secretary or a Federal department or
      agency has an agreement for exchange of these products without
      cost; and
        (2) at prices which the Secretary establishes, to the
      departments and officers of the United States requiring them for
      official use.

      (d) The fees provided for in this section are for the purpose of
    reimbursing the United States Government for the costs of creating,
    publishing or distributing nautical products of the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The collection of fees
    authorized by this section shall not alter or expand any duty or
    liability of the United States under existing law for the
    performance of functions for which fees are collected, nor shall
    the collection of fees constitute an express or implied undertaking
    by the United States to perform any activity in a certain manner.
      (e) For purposes of this section, the term "nautical products"
    includes all nautical charts, tide and tidal current tables, tidal
    current charts, coast pilots, water level products, and associated
    data bases which are created or published by the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration.

    TITLE 44 - PUBLIC PRINTING AND DOCUMENTS
    CHAPTER 15 - FEDERAL REGISTER AND CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1505. Documents to be published in Federal Register

-STATUTE-
      (a) Proclamations and Executive Orders; Documents Having General
    Applicability and Legal Effect; Documents Required To Be Published
    by Congress. There shall be published in the Federal Register - 
        (1) Presidential proclamations and Executive orders, except
      those not having general applicability and legal effect or
      effective only against Federal agencies or persons in their
      capacity as officers, agents, or employees thereof;
        (2) documents or classes of documents that the President may
      determine from time to time have general applicability and legal
      effect; and
        (3) documents or classes of documents that may be required so
      to be published by Act of Congress.

      For the purposes of this chapter every document or order which
    prescribes a penalty has general applicability and legal effect.
      (b) Documents Authorized To Be Published by Regulations; Comments
    and News Items Excluded. In addition to the foregoing there shall
    also be published in the Federal Register other documents or
    classes of documents authorized to be published by regulations
    prescribed under this chapter with the approval of the President,
    but comments or news items of any character may not be published in
    the Federal Register.
      (c) Suspension of Requirements for Filing of Documents; Alternate
    Systems for Promulgating, Filing, or Publishing Documents;
    Preservation of Originals. In the event of an attack or threatened
    attack upon the continental United States and a determination by
    the President that as a result of an attack or threatened attack - 
        (1) publication of the Federal Register or filing of documents
      with the Office of the Federal Register is impracticable, or
        (2) under existing conditions publication in the Federal
      Register would not serve to give appropriate notice to the public
      of the contents of documents, the President may, without regard
      to any other provision of law, suspend all or part of the
      requirements of law or regulation for filing with the Office or
      publication in the Federal Register of documents or classes of
      documents.

      The suspensions shall remain in effect until revoked by the
    President, or by concurrent resolution of the Congress. The
    President shall establish alternate systems for promulgating,
    filing, or publishing documents or classes of documents affected by
    such suspensions, including requirements relating to their
    effectiveness or validity, that may be considered under the then
    existing circumstances practicable to provide public notice of the
    issuance and of the contents of the documents. The alternate
    systems may, without limitation, provide for the use of regional or
    specialized publications or depositories for documents, or of the
    press, the radio, or similar mediums of general communication.
    Compliance with alternate systems of filing or publication shall
    have the same effect as filing with the Office or publication in
    the Federal Register under this chapter or other law or regulation.
    With respect to documents promulgated under alternate systems, each
    agency shall preserve the original and two duplicate originals or
    two certified copies for filing with the Office when the President
    determines that it is practicable.

    Sec. 1507. Filing document as constructive notice; publication in
      Federal Register as presumption of validity; judicial notice;
      citation

-STATUTE-
      A document required by section 1505(a) of this title to be
    published in the Federal Register is not valid as against a person
    who has not had actual knowledge of it until the duplicate
    originals or certified copies of the document have been filed with
    the Office of the Federal Register and a copy made available for
    public inspection as provided by section 1503 of this title. Unless
    otherwise specifically provided by statute, filing of a document,
    required or authorized to be published by section 1505 of this
    title, except in cases where notice by publication is insufficient
    in law, is sufficient to give notice of the contents of the
    document to a person subject to or affected by it. The publication
    in the Federal Register of a document creates a rebuttable
    presumption - 
        (1) that it was duly issued, prescribed, or promulgated;
        (2) that it was filed with the Office of the Federal Register
      and made available for public inspection at the day and hour
      stated in the printed notation;
        (3) that the copy contained in the Federal Register is a true
      copy of the original; and
        (4) that all requirements of this chapter and the regulations
      prescribed under it relative to the document have been complied
      with.

      The contents of the Federal Register shall be judicially noticed
    and without prejudice to any other mode of citation, may be cited
    by volume and page number.

-STATUTE-
      A notice of hearing or of opportunity to be heard, required or
    authorized to be given by an Act of Congress, or which may
    otherwise properly be given, shall be deemed to have been given to
    all persons residing within the States of the Union and the
    District of Columbia, except in cases where notice by publication
    is insufficient in law, when the notice is published in the Federal
    Register at such a time that the period between the publication and
    the date fixed in the notice for the hearing or for the termination
    of the opportunity to be heard is - 
        (1) not less than the time specifically prescribed for the
      publication of the notice by the appropriate Act of Congress; or
        (2) not less than fifteen days when time for publication is not
      specifically prescribed by the Act, without prejudice, however,
      to the effectiveness of a notice of less than fifteen days where
      the shorter period is reasonable.

    considers necessary, the preparation and publication in special or
    supplemental editions of the Federal Register of complete
    codifications of the documents of each agency of the Government

    Committee.
      (b) A codification published under subsection (a) of this section

      (f) The Administrative Committee shall prescribe, with the
    approval of the President, regulations for carrying out this

-STATUTE-
      Upon request of the Superintendent of Documents, components of
    the Government ordering the printing of publications shall either
    increase or decrease the number of copies of publications furnished
    for distribution to designated depository libraries and State
    libraries so that the number of copies delivered to the
    Superintendent of Documents is equal to the number of libraries on
    the list. The number thus delivered may not be restricted by any
    statutory limitation in force on August 9, 1962. Copies of
    publications furnished the Superintendent of Documents for
    distribution to designated depository libraries shall include - 
        the journals of the Senate and House of Representatives;
        all publications, not confidential in character, printed upon
      the requisition of a congressional committee;
        Senate and House public bills and resolutions; and
        reports on private bills, concurrent or simple resolutions;

    but not so-called cooperative publications which must necessarily
    be sold in order to be self-sustaining.
      The Superintendent of Documents shall currently inform the
    components of the Government ordering printing of publications as
    to the number of copies of their publications required for
    distribution to depository libraries. The cost of printing and
    binding those publications distributed to depository libraries
    obtained elsewhere than from the Government Printing Office, shall
    be borne by components of the Government responsible for their
    issuance; those requisitioned from the Government Printing Office
    shall be charged to appropriations provided the Superintendent of
    Documents for that purpose.

    Sec. 1905. Distribution to depositories; designation of additional
      libraries; justification; authorization for certain designations

-STATUTE-
      The Government publications selected from lists prepared by the
    Superintendent of Documents, and when requested from him, shall be
    distributed to depository libraries specifically designated by law
    and to libraries designated by Senators, Representatives, and the
    Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, by the Commissioner of the
    District of Columbia,(!1) and by the Governors of Guam, American
    Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, respectively. Additional libraries
    within areas served by Representatives or the Resident Commissioner
    from Puerto Rico may be designated by them to receive Government
    publications to the extent that the total number of libraries
    designated by them does not exceed two within each area. Not more
    than two additional libraries within a State may be designated by
    each Senator from the State. Before an additional library within a
    State, congressional district or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is
    designated as a depository for Government publications, the head of
    that library shall furnish his Senator, Representative, or the
    Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, as the case may be, with
    justification of the necessity for the additional designation. The
    justification, which shall also include a certification as to the
    need for the additional depository library designation, shall be
    signed by the head of every existing depository library within the
    congressional district or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or by the
    head of the library authority of the State or the Commonwealth of
    Puerto Rico, within which the additional depository library is to
    be located. The justification for additional depository library
    designations shall be transmitted to the Superintendent of
    Documents by the Senator, Representative, or the Resident
    Commissioner from Puerto Rico, as the case may be. The Commissioner
    of the District of Columbia may designate two depository libraries
    in the District of Columbia, the Governor of Guam and the Governor
    of American Samoa may each designate one depository library in Guam
    and American Samoa, respectively, and the Governor of the Virgin
    Islands may designate one depository library on the island of Saint
    Thomas and one on the island of Saint Croix.

-STATUTE-
      Only a library able to provide custody and service for depository
    materials and located in an area where it can best serve the public
    need, and within an area not already adequately served by existing
    depository libraries may be designated by Senators,
    Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, the
    Commissioner of the District of Columbia,(!1) or the Governors of
    Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands as a depository of
    Government publications. The designated depository libraries shall
    report to the Superintendent of Documents at least every two years
    concerning their condition.

      The Superintendent of Documents shall make firsthand
    investigation of conditions for which need is indicated and include
    the results of investigations in his annual report. When he
    ascertains that the number of books in a depository library is
    below ten thousand, other than Government publications, or it has
    ceased to be maintained so as to be accessible to the public, or
    that the Government publications which have been furnished the
    library have not been properly maintained, he shall delete the
    library from the list of depository libraries if the library fails
    to correct the unsatisfactory conditions within six months. The
    Representative or the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico in
    whose area the library is located or the Senator who made the
    designation, or a successor of the Senator, and, in the case of a
    library in the District of Columbia, the Commissioner of the
    District of Columbia, and, in the case of a library in Guam,
    American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands, the Governor, shall be
    notified and shall then be authorized to designate another library
    within the area served by him, which shall meet the conditions
    herein required, but which may not be in excess of the number of
    depository libraries authorized by laws within the State, district,
    territory, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as the case may be.

    Sec. 1912. Regional depositories; designation; functions; disposal
      of publications

-STATUTE-
      Not more than two depository libraries in each State and the
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be designated as regional
    depositories, and shall receive from the Superintendent of
    Documents copies of all new and revised Government publications
    authorized for distribution to depository libraries. Designation of
    regional depository libraries may be made by a Senator or the
    Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico within the areas served by
    them, after approval by the head of the library authority of the
    State or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as the case may be, who
    shall first ascertain from the head of the library to be so
    designated that the library will, in addition to fulfilling the
    requirements for depository libraries, retain at least one copy of
    all Government publications either in printed or microfacsimile
    form (except those authorized to be discarded by the Superintendent
    of Documents); and within the region served will provide
    interlibrary loan, reference service, and assistance for depository
    libraries in the disposal of unwanted Government publications. The
    agreement to function as a regional depository library shall be
    transmitted to the Superintendent of Documents by the Senator or
    the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico when the designation is
    made.
      The libraries designated as regional depositories may permit
    depository libraries, within the areas served by them, to dispose
    of Government publications which they have retained for five years
    after first offering them to other depository libraries within
    their area, then to other libraries.

        PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION    
      Pub. L. 102-526, Oct. 26, 1992, 106 Stat. 3443, as amended by
    Pub. L. 103-345, Secs. 2-5, Oct. 6, 1994, 108 Stat. 3128-3130; Pub.

    Sec. 2(c)(1), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1735, provided that:

      "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
      "This Act may be cited as the 'President John F. Kennedy
    Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992'.

      "SEC. 2. FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS, AND PURPOSES.
      "(a) Findings and Declarations. - The Congress finds and declares
    that - 
        "(1) all Government records related to the assassination of
      President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical and
      governmental purposes;
        "(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of
      President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate
      disclosure, and all records should be eventually disclosed to
      enable the public to become fully informed about the history
      surrounding the assassination;
        "(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable,
      independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of
      such records;
        "(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records
      related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would
      not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the
      year 2029;
        "(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of
      Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], as implemented by the executive
      branch, has prevented the timely public disclosure of records
      relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy;
        "(6) legislation is necessary because Executive Order No. 12356
      [50 U.S.C. 435 note], entitled 'National Security Information'
      has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules
      relating to classified information across government and has
      prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the
      assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and
        "(7) most of the records related to the assassination of
      President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in
      the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued
      protection of such records.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act are - 
        "(1) to provide for the creation of the President John F.
      Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives
      and Records Administration; and
        "(2) to require the expeditious public transmission to the
      Archivist and public disclosure of such records.

      "(C) The periodic review of postponed assassination records shall
    serve to downgrade and declassify security classified information.
      "(D) Each assassination record shall be publicly disclosed in
    full, and available in the Collection no later than the date that
    is 25 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 26,
    1992], unless the President certifies, as required by this Act,
    that - 
        "(i) continued postponement is made necessary by an
      identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence
      operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and
        "(ii) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it
      outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
      "(h) Fees for Copying. - Executive branch agencies shall - 
        "(1) charge fees for copying assassination records; and
        "(2) grant waivers of such fees pursuant to the standards

      "SEC. 6. GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF
        RECORDS.
      "Disclosure of assassination records or particular information in
    assassination records to the public may be postponed subject to the
    limitations of this Act if there is clear and convincing evidence
    that - 
        "(1) the threat to the military defense, intelligence
      operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States
      posed by the public disclosure of the assassination record is of
      such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and such
      public disclosure would reveal - 
          "(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently requires
        protection;
          "(B) an intelligence source or method which is currently
        utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the United
        States Government and which has not been officially disclosed,
        the disclosure of which would interfere with the conduct of
        intelligence activities; or
          "(C) any other matter currently relating to the military
        defense, intelligence operations or conduct of foreign
        relations of the United States, the disclosure of which would
        demonstrably impair the national security of the United States;
        "(2) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
      reveal the name or identity of a living person who provided
      confidential information to the United States and would pose a
      substantial risk of harm to that person;
        "(3) the public disclosure of the assassination record could
      reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of
      personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so substantial
      that it outweighs the public interest;
        "(4) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
      compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality
      currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a
      cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public
      disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public
      interest; or
        "(5) the public disclosure of the assassination record would
      reveal a security or protective procedure currently utilized, or
      reasonably expected to be utilized, by the Secret Service or
      another Government agency responsible for protecting Government
      officials, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it
      outweighs the public interest.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2108. Responsibility for custody, use, and withdrawal of
      records

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Archivist shall be responsible for the custody, use, and
    withdrawal of records transferred to him. When records, the use of
    which is subject to statutory limitations and restrictions, are so
    transferred, permissive and restrictive statutory provisions with
    respect to the examination and use of records applicable to the
    head of the agency from which the records were transferred or to
    employees of that agency are applicable to the Archivist and to the
    employees of the National Archives and Records Administration,
    respectively. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,
    when the head of a Federal agency states, in writing, restrictions
    that appear to him to be necessary or desirable in the public
    interest with respect to the use or examination of records being
    considered for transfer from his custody to the Archivist, the
    Archivist shall, if he concurs,,(!1) impose such restrictions on
    the records so transferred, and may not relax or remove such
    restrictions without the written concurrence of the head of the
    agency from which the material was transferred, or of his successor
    in function, if any. In the event that a Federal agency is
    terminated and there is no successor in function, the Archivist is
    authorized to relax, remove, or impose restrictions on such
    agency's records when he determines that such action is in the
    public interest. Statutory and other restrictions referred to in
    this subsection shall remain in force until the records have been
    in existence for thirty years unless the Archivist by order, having
    consulted with the head of the transferring Federal agency or his
    successor in function, determines, with respect to specific bodies
    of records, that for reasons consistent with standards established
    in relevant statutory law, such restrictions shall remain in force
    for a longer period. Restriction on the use or examination of
    records deposited with the National Archives of the United States
    imposed by section 3 of the National Archives Act, approved June
    19, 1934, shall continue in force regardless of the expiration of
    the tenure of office of the official who imposed them but may be
    removed or relaxed by the Archivist with the concurrence in writing
    of the head of the agency from which material was transferred or of
    his successor in function, if any.

      (b) With regard to the census and survey records of the Bureau of
    the Census containing data identifying individuals enumerated in
    population censuses, any release pursuant to this section of such
    identifying information contained in such records shall be made by
    the Archivist pursuant to the specifications and agreements set
    forth in the exchange of correspondence on or about the date of
    October 10, 1952, between the Director of the Bureau of the Census
    and the Archivist of the United States, together with all
    amendments thereto, now or hereafter entered into between the
    Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Archivist of the
    United States. Such amendments, if any, shall be published in the
    Register.

    papers, pamphlets, works of art, models, pictures, photographs,
    plats, maps, films, motion pictures, sound recordings, and other

      NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me, as
    President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

    program missions, to confer with the Archivist of the United
    States, or his designee, for the purpose of assuring that any such
    exhibits or displays which the Archivist finds appropriate for
    supplemental exhibition as part of the archival and cultural
    heritage of the United States are prepared, produced, or otherwise
    created in a manner which assures, to the maximum possible extent,
    their appropriateness, after they have served their primary program
    purpose, for such supplemental exhibition, and
      (b) to transfer to the Archivist, without reimbursement, such
    exhibits or displays as he determines are appropriate for such
    supplemental exhibition after they have served their primary
    program purpose, subject to such conditions requiring return to the
    department or agency of all or any of the materials incorporated in
    the exhibits or displays as may be mutually agreeable.
      Sec. 2. The Archivist of the United States is directed to - 
      (a) provide advice, counsel, and assistance to the heads of
    executive departments and agencies in the preparation, production,
    or other creation of exhibits and displays which he finds will have
    future value for exhibition as part of the archival and cultural
    heritage of the United States; and
      (b) accept any such exhibit or display when it has served its
    primary program purpose and (1) arrange for its supplemental
    exhibition as appropriate, (2) preserve any such exhibit or display
    which possesses sufficient historical or other value to warrant
    continued preservation, or (3) dispose of any such exhibit or
    display when, in his judgment, the reasons for its continued
    preservation or exhibition cease to exist, all subject to the
    conditions agreed upon incident to transfer to the Archivist of the
    United States of the exhibit or display.

     "TITLE I - PRESERVATION OF PRESIDENTIAL RECORDINGS AND MATERIALS 

         "DELIVERY AND RETENTION OF CERTAIN PRESIDENTIAL MATERIALS     
      "Sec. 101. (a) Notwithstanding any other law or any agreement or
    understanding made pursuant to section 2111 of title 44, United
    States Code any Federal employee in possession shall deliver, and
    the Archivist of the United States (hereinafter referred to as the
    'Archivist') shall receive, obtain, or retain, complete possession
    and control of all original tape recordings of conversations which
    were recorded or caused to be recorded by any officer or employee
    of the Federal Government and which - 
        "(1) involve former President Richard M. Nixon or other
      individuals who, at the time of the conversation, were employed
      by the Federal Government;
        "(2) were recorded in the White House or in the office of the
      President in the Executive Office Buildings located in
      Washington, District of Columbia; Camp David, Maryland; Key
      Biscayne, Florida; or San Clemente, California; and
        "(3) were recorded during the period beginning January 20,
      1969, and ending August 9, 1974.
      "(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other law or any agreement or
    understanding made pursuant to section 2111 of title 44, United
    States Code, the Archivist shall receive, retain, or make
    reasonable efforts to obtain, complete possession and control of
    all papers, documents, memorandums, transcripts, and other objects
    and materials which constitute the Presidential historical
    materials of Richard M. Nixon, covering the period beginning
    January 20, 1969, and ending August 9, 1974.
      "(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term 'historical
    materials' has the meaning given it by section 2101 of title 44,
    United States Code.

              "AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRESIDENTIAL MATERIALS          
      "Sec. 102. (a) None of the tape recordings or other materials
    referred to in section 101 shall be destroyed, except as hereafter
    may be provided by law.
      "(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any other
    law, or any agreement or understanding made pursuant to section
    2111 of title 44, United States Code, the tape recordings and other
    materials referred to in section 101 shall, immediately upon the
    date of enactment of this title, be made available, subject to any
    rights, defenses, or privileges which the Federal Government or any
    person may invoke, for use in any judicial proceeding or otherwise
    subject to court subpena or other legal process. Any request by the
    Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, whether by court
    subpena or other lawful process, for access to such recordings or
    materials shall at all times have priority over any other request
    for such recordings or materials.
      "(c) Richard M. Nixon, or any person whom he may designate in
    writing, shall at all times have access to the tape recordings and
    other materials referred to in section 101 for any purpose which is
    consistent with the provisions of this title, subsequent and
    subject to the regulations which the Archivist shall issue pursuant
    to section 103.
      "(d) Any agency or department in the executive branch of the
    Federal Government shall at all times have access to the tape
    recordings and other materials referred to in section 101 for
    lawful Government use, subject to the regulations which the
    Archivist shall issue pursuant to section 103.

    "REGULATIONS TO PROTECT CERTAIN TAPE RECORDINGS AND OTHER MATERIALS
      "Sec. 103. The Archivist shall issue at the earliest possible
    date such regulations as may be necessary to assure the protection
    of the tape recordings and other materials referred to in section
    101 from loss or destruction, and to prevent access to such
    recordings and materials by unauthorized persons. The Archivist may
    transfer such recordings and materials to a Presidential archival
    depository in accordance with section 2112 of title 44, United
    States Code.

                  "REGULATIONS RELATING TO PUBLIC ACCESS              
      "Sec. 104. (a) The Archivist shall, within ninety days after the
    date of enactment of this title [Dec. 19, 1974], submit to each
    House of the Congress a report proposing and explaining regulations
    that would provide public access to the tape recordings and other
    materials referred to in section 101. Such regulations shall take
    into account the following factors:
        "(1) the need to provide the public with the full truth, at the
      earliest reasonable date, of the abuses of governmental power
      popularly identified under the generic term 'Watergate';
        "(2) the need to make such recordings and materials available
      for use in judicial proceedings;
        "(3) the need to prevent general access, except in accordance
      with appropriate procedures established for use in judicial
      proceedings to information relating to the Nation's security;
        "(4) the need to protect every individual's right to a fair and
      impartial trial;
        "(5) the need to protect any party's opportunity to assert any
      legally or constitutionally based right or privilege which would
      prevent or otherwise limit access to such recordings and
      materials;
        "(6) the need to provide public access to those materials which
      have general historical significance, and which are not likely to
      be related to the need described in paragraph (1); and
        "(7) the need to give to Richard M. Nixon, or his heirs, for
      his sole custody and use, tape recordings and other materials
      which are not likely to be related to the need described in
      paragraph (1) and are not otherwise of general historical
      significance.
      "(b) The regulations proposed by the Archivist in the report
    required by subsection (a) shall not take effect until the
    expiration of the first period of 60 calendar days of continuous
    session of the Congress after the date of the submission of such
    regulations to each House of the Congress. For the purposes of this
    subsection, continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment
    of Congress sine die, but the days on which either House is not in
    session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day
    certain are excluded.
      "(c) The provisions of this title shall not apply, on and after
    the date upon which regulations proposed by the Administrator take
    effect under subsection (b), to any tape recordings or other
    materials given to Richard M. Nixon, or his heirs, pursuant to
    subsection (a)(7).
      "(d) The provisions of this title shall not in any way affect the
    rights, limitations or exemptions applicable under the Freedom of
    Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552 et seq.

                             "JUDICIAL REVIEW

    of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear challenges to
    the legal or constitutional validity of this title or of any
    regulation issued under the authority granted by this title, and
    any action or proceeding involving the question of title,
    ownership, custody, possession, or control of any tape recording or
    material referred to in section 101 or involving payment of any
    just compensation which may be due in connection therewith. Any
    such challenge shall be treated by the court as a matter requiring
    immediate consideration and resolution, and such challenge shall
    have priority on the docket of such court over other cases.
      "(b) If, under the procedures established by subsection (a), a
    judicial decision is rendered that a particular provision of this
    title, or a particular regulation issued under the authority
    granted by this title, is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid,
    such decision shall not affect in any way the validity or
    enforcement of any other provision of this title or any regulation
    issued under the authority granted by this title.
      "(c) If a final decision of such court holds that any provision
    of this title has deprived an individual of private property
    without just compensation, then there shall be paid out of the
    general fund of the Treasury of the United States such amount or
    amounts as may be adjudged just by that Court.

    the report required under paragraph (3) of this subsection with
    respect to such Presidential archival depository or the report
    required under paragraph (4) of this subsection with respect to
    such change or addition, as the case may be.
      (b) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest,
    he may deposit in a Presidential archival depository papers,
    documents, or other historical materials accepted under section
    2111 of this title, or Federal records appropriate for
    preservation.
      (c) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest,
    he may exercise, with respect to papers, documents, or other
    historical materials deposited under this section, or otherwise, in
    a Presidential archival depository, all the functions and
    responsibilities otherwise vested in him pertaining to Federal
    records or other documentary materials in his custody or under his
    control. The Archivist, in negotiating for the deposit of
    Presidential historical materials, shall take steps to secure to
    the Government, as far as possible, the right to have continuous
    and permanent possession of the materials. Papers, documents, or
    other historical materials accepted and deposited under section
    2111 of this title and this section are subject to restrictions as
    to their availability and use stated in writing by the donors or
    depositors, including the restriction that they shall be kept in a
    Presidential archival depository. The restrictions shall be
    respected for the period stated, or until revoked or terminated by
    the donors or depositors or by persons legally qualified to act on
    their behalf. Subject to the restrictions, the Archivist may
    dispose by sale, exchange, or otherwise, of papers, documents, or
    other materials which the Archivist determines to have no permanent
    value or historical interest or to be surplus to the needs of a
    Presidential archival depository. Only the first two sentences of
    this subsection shall apply to Presidential records as defined in
    section 2201(2) of this title.
      (d) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest,
    he may cooperate with and assist a university, institution of
    higher learning, institute, foundation, or other organization or
    qualified individual to further or to conduct study or research in
    historical materials deposited in a Presidential archival
    depository.
      (e) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest,
    he may charge and collect reasonable fees for the privilege of
    visiting and viewing exhibit rooms or museum space, or for the
    occasional, non-official use of rooms and spaces (and services
    related to such use), in a Presidential archival depository.
      (f) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public interest,
    he may provide reasonable office space in a Presidential archival
    depository for the personal use of a former President of the United
    States.
      (g)(1) When the Archivist considers it to be in the public
    interest, the Archivist may solicit and accept gifts or bequests of
    money or other property for the purpose of maintaining, operating,
    protecting, or improving a Presidential archival depository. The
    proceeds of gifts or bequests, together with the proceeds from fees
    or from sales of historical materials, copies or reproductions,
    catalogs, or other items, having to do with a Presidential archival
    depository, shall be paid into an account in the National Archives
    Trust Fund and shall be held, administered, and expended for the
    benefit and in the interest of the Presidential archival depository
    in connection with which they were received, and for the same
    purposes and objects, including custodial and administrative
    services for which appropriations for the maintenance, operation,
    protection, or improvement of Presidential archival depositories
    might be expended.
      (2) The Archivist shall provide for the establishment in such
    Trust Fund of separate endowments for the maintenance of the land,
    facility, and equipment of each Presidential archival depository,
    to which shall be credited any gifts or bequests received under
    paragraph (1) that are offered for that purpose. Income to each
    such endowment shall be available to cover the cost of facility
    operations, but shall not be available for the performance of
    archival functions under this title.
      (3) The Archivist shall not accept or take title to any land,
    facility, or equipment under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1),
    or enter into any agreement to use any land, facility, or equipment
    under subparagraph (B) of such subsection for the purpose of
    creating a Presidential archival depository, unless the Archivist
    determines that there is available, by gift or bequest for deposit
    under paragraph (2) of this subsection in an endowment with respect
    to such depository, an amount for the purpose of maintaining such
    land, facility, and equipment equal to - 
        (A) the product of - 
          (i) the total cost of acquiring or constructing such facility
        and of acquiring and installing such equipment, multiplied by
          (ii) 20 percent; plus

        (B)(i) if title to the land is to be vested in the United
      States, the product of - 
          (I) the total cost of acquiring the land upon which such
        facility is located, or such other measure of the value of such
        land as is mutually agreed upon by the Archivist and the donor,
        multiplied by
          (II) 20 percent; or

        (ii) if title to the land is not to be vested in the United
      States, the product of - 
          (I) the total cost to the donor of any improvements to the
        land upon which such facility is located (other than such
        facility and equipment), multiplied by

      square feet in area, an amount equal to the product of -

        feet by which such depository will exceed 70,000 square feet by

      (4) If a proposed physical or material change or addition to a
    Presidential archival depository would result in an increase in the
    costs of facility operations, the Archivist may not accept any gift
    under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) for the purpose of making
    such a change or addition, or may not implement any provision of
    law requiring the making of such a change or addition, unless the
    Archivist determines that there is available, by gift or bequest
    for deposit under paragraph (2) of this subsection in an endowment
    with respect to such depository, an amount for the purpose of
    maintaining the land, facility, and equipment of such depository
    equal to the difference between -

      deposit in such endowment with respect to such depository if such
      change or addition had been included in such depository on - 
          (i) the date on which the Archivist took title to the land,
        facility, and equipment for such depository under subparagraph
        (A) of subsection (a)(1); or
          (ii) the date on which the Archivist entered into an
        agreement for the creation of such depository under
        subparagraph (B) of such paragraph,

      as the case may be; minus
        (B) the amount which, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this
      subsection, was required to be available for deposit in such
      endowment with respect to such depository on the date the
      Archivist took such title or entered into such agreement, as the
      case may be.

      (5)(A) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) (to the extent that
    such paragraphs are inconsistent with this paragraph), this
    subsection shall be administered in accordance with this paragraph
    with respect to any Presidential archival depository created as a
    depository for the papers, documents, and other historical
    materials and Presidential records pertaining to any President who
    takes the oath of office as President for the first time on or
    after July 1, 2002.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraphs (A)(ii), (B)(i)(II), and

    means the amount of the endowment required under paragraph (3).
      (ii)(I) The Archivist may give credits against the base endowment
    amount if the Archivist determines that the proposed Presidential
    archival depository will have construction features or equipment
    that are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to
    the Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.
      (II) The features and equipment described under subclause (I)
    shall comply with the standards promulgated by the Archivist under
    subsection (a)(2).
      (III) The Archivist shall promulgate standards to be used in
    calculating the dollar amount of any credit to be given, and shall
    consult with all donors of the endowment before giving any credits.
    The total dollar amount of credits given under this paragraph may
    not exceed 20 percent of the base endowment amount.
      (D)(i) In calculating the additional endowment amount required
    under paragraph (4), the Archivist shall take into account credits
    given under subparagraph (C), and may also give credits against the
    additional endowment amount required under paragraph (4), if the
    Archivist determines that construction features or equipment used
    in making or equipping the physical or material change or addition
    are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to the
    Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.
      (ii) The features and equipment described under clause (i) shall
    comply with the standards promulgated by the Archivist under
    subsection (a)(2).

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2116. Legal status of reproductions; official seal; fees for
      copies and reproductions

-STATUTE-
      (a) When records that are required by statute to be retained
    indefinitely have been reproduced by photographic,
    microphotographic, or other processes, in accordance with standards
    established by the Archivist the indefinite retention by the
    photographic, microphotographic, or other reproductions constitutes
    compliance with the statutory requirement for the indefinite
    retention of the original records. The reproductions, as well as
    reproductions made under regulations to carry out chapter 21, 29,
    31, and 33 of this title, shall have the same legal status as the
    originals.
      (b) There shall be an official seal for the National Archives of
    the United States which shall be judicially noticed. When a copy or
    reproduction, furnished under this section, is authenticated by the
    official seal and certified by the Archivist, the copy or
    reproduction shall be admitted in evidence equally with the
    original from which it was made.
      (c) The Archivist may charge a fee set to recover the costs for
    making or authenticating copies or reproductions of materials
    transferred to his custody. Such fee shall be fixed by the
    Archivist at a level which will recover, so far as practicable, all
    elements of such costs, and may, in the Archivist's discretion,
    include increments for the estimated replacement cost of equipment.
    Such fees shall be paid into, administered, and expended as a part
    of the National Archives Trust Fund. The Archivist may not charge
    for making or authenticating copies or reproductions of materials
    for official use by the United States Government unless
    appropriations available to the Archivist for this purpose are
    insufficient to cover the cost of performing the work.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2203. Management and custody of Presidential records

-STATUTE-
      (a) Through the implementation of records management controls and
    other necessary actions, the President shall take all such steps as
    may be necessary to assure that the activities, deliberations,
    decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of his
    constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties
    are adequately documented and that such records are maintained as
    Presidential records pursuant to the requirements of this section
    and other provisions of law.
      (b) Documentary materials produced or received by the President,
    his staff, or units or individuals in the Executive Office of the
    President the function of which is to advise and assist the
    President, shall, to the extent practicable, be categorized as
    Presidential records or personal records upon their creation or
    receipt and be filed separately.
      (c) During his term of office, the President may dispose of those
    of his Presidential records that no longer have administrative,
    historical, informational, or evidentiary value if - 
        (1) the President obtains the views, in writing, of the
      Archivist concerning the proposed disposal of such Presidential
      records; and
        (2) the Archivist states that he does not intend to take any
      action under subsection (e) of this section.

      (d) In the event the Archivist notifies the President under
    subsection (c) that he does intend to take action under subsection
    (e), the President may dispose of such Presidential records if
    copies of the disposal schedule are submitted to the appropriate
    Congressional Committees at least 60 calendar days of continuous
    session of Congress in advance of the proposed disposal date. For
    the purpose of this section, continuity of session is broken only
    by an adjournment of Congress sine die, and the days on which
    either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more
    than three days to a day certain are excluded in the computation of
    the days in which Congress is in continuous session.
      (e) The Archivist shall request the advice of the Committee on
    Rules and Administration and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
    of the Senate and the Committee on House Oversight and the
    Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives
    with respect to any proposed disposal of Presidential records
    whenever he considers that - 
        (1) these particular records may be of special interest to the
      Congress; or
        (2) consultation with the Congress regarding the disposal of
      these particular records is in the public interest.

      (f)(1) Upon the conclusion of a President's term of office, or if
    a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the
    last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume
    responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and
    access to, the Presidential records of that President. The
    Archivist shall have an affirmative duty to make such records
    available to the public as rapidly and completely as possible
    consistent with the provisions of this Act.
      (2) The Archivist shall deposit all such Presidential records in
    a Presidential archival depository or another archival facility
    operated by the United States. The Archivist is authorized to
    designate, after consultation with the former President, a director
    at each depository or facility, who shall be responsible for the
    care and preservation of such records.
      (3) The Archivist is authorized to dispose of such Presidential
    records which he has appraised and determined to have insufficient
    administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to
    warrant their continued preservation. Notice of such disposal shall
    be published in the Federal Register at least 60 days in advance of
    the proposed disposal date. Publication of such notice shall
    constitute a final agency action for purposes of review under
    chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 2204. Restrictions on access to Presidential records

-STATUTE-
      (a) Prior to the conclusion of his term of office or last
    consecutive term of office, as the case may be, the President shall
    specify durations, not to exceed 12 years, for which access shall
    be restricted with respect to information, in a Presidential
    record, within one or more of the following categories:
        (1)(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an
      Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national
      defense or foreign policy and (B) in fact properly classified
      pursuant to such Executive order;
        (2) relating to appointments to Federal office;
        (3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other
      than sections 552 and 552b of title 5, United States Code),
      provided that such statute (A) requires that the material be
      withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no
      discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria
      for withholding or refers to particular types of material to be
      withheld;
        (4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
      obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
        (5) confidential communications requesting or submitting
      advice, between the President and his advisers, or between such
      advisers; or
        (6) personnel and medical files and similar files the
      disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
      invasion of personal privacy.

      (b)(1) Any Presidential record or reasonably segregable portion
    thereof containing information within a category restricted by the
    President under subsection (a) shall be so designated by the
    Archivist and access thereto shall be restricted until the earlier
    of - 
        (A)(i) the date on which the former President waives the
      restriction on disclosure of such record, or
        (ii) the expiration of the duration specified under subsection
      (a) for the category of information on the basis of which access
      to such record has been restricted; or
        (B) upon a determination by the Archivist that such record or
      reasonably segregable portion thereof, or of any significant
      element or aspect of the information contained in such record or
      reasonably segregable portion thereof, has been placed in the
      public domain through publication by the former President, or his
      agents.

      (2) Any such record which does not contain information within a
    category restricted by the President under subsection (a), or
    contains information within such a category for which the duration
    of restricted access has expired, shall be exempt from the
    provisions of subsection (c) until the earlier of - 
        (A) the date which is 5 years after the date on which the
      Archivist obtains custody of such record pursuant to section
      2203(d)(1); or
        (B) the date on which the Archivist completes the processing
      and organization of such records or integral file segment
      thereof.

      (3) During the period of restricted access specified pursuant to
    subsection (b)(1), the determination whether access to a
    Presidential record or reasonably segregable portion thereof shall
    be restricted shall be made by the Archivist, in his discretion,
    after consultation with the former President, and, during such
    period, such determinations shall not be subject to judicial
    review, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section. The
    Archivist shall establish procedures whereby any person denied
    access to a Presidential record because such record is restricted
    pursuant to a determination made under this paragraph, may file an
    administrative appeal of such determination. Such procedures shall
    provide for a written determination by the Archivist or his
    designee, within 30 working days after receipt of such an appeal,
    setting forth the basis for such determination.
      (c)(1) Subject to the limitations on access imposed pursuant to
    subsections (a) and (b), Presidential records shall be administered
    in accordance with section 552 of title 5, United States Code,
    except that paragraph (b)(5) of that section shall not be available
    for purposes of withholding any Presidential record, and for the
    purposes of such section such records shall be deemed to be records
    of the National Archives and Records Administration. Access to such
    records shall be granted on nondiscriminatory terms.
      (2) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to confirm, limit, or
    expand any constitutionally-based privilege which may be available
    to an incumbent or former President.
      (d) Upon the death or disability of a President or former
    President, any discretion or authority the President or former
    President may have had under this chapter shall be exercised by the
    Archivist unless otherwise previously provided by the President or
    former President in a written notice to the Archivist.
      (e) The United States District Court for the District of Columbia
    shall have jurisdiction over any action initiated by the former
    President asserting that a determination made by the Archivist
    violates the former President's rights or privileges.

    by Ex. Ord. No. 13489, Sec. 6, Jan. 21, 2009, 74 F.R. 4671, set out
    below.

                 EX. ORD. NO. 13489. PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS             
      Ex. Ord. No. 13489, Jan. 21, 2009, 74 F.R. 4669, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    establish policies and procedures governing the assertion of
    executive privilege by incumbent and former Presidents in
    connection with the release of Presidential records by the National
    Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the
    Presidential Records Act of 1978, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
      (a) "Archivist" refers to the Archivist of the United States or
    his designee.
      (b) "NARA" refers to the National Archives and Records
    Administration.
      (c) "Presidential Records Act" refers to the Presidential Records
    Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.
      (d) "NARA regulations" refers to the NARA regulations
    implementing the Presidential Records Act [of 1978], 36 C.F.R. Part
    1270.
      (e) "Presidential records" refers to those documentary materials
    maintained by NARA pursuant to the Presidential Records Act,
    including Vice Presidential records.
      (f) "Former President" refers to the former President during
    whose term or terms of office particular Presidential records were
    created.
      (g) A "substantial question of executive privilege" exists if
    NARA's disclosure of Presidential records might impair national
    security (including the conduct of foreign relations), law
    enforcement, or the deliberative processes of the executive branch.
      (h) A "final court order" is a court order from which no appeal
    may be taken.
      Sec. 2. Notice of Intent to Disclose Presidential Records. (a)
    When the Archivist provides notice to the incumbent and former
    Presidents of his intent to disclose Presidential records pursuant
    to section 1270.46 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist, using
    any guidelines provided by the incumbent and former Presidents,
    shall identify any specific materials, the disclosure of which he
    believes may raise a substantial question of executive privilege.
    However, nothing in this order is intended to affect the right of
    the incumbent or former Presidents to invoke executive privilege
    with respect to materials not identified by the Archivist. Copies
    of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the
    President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney
    General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of
    Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President
    shall be delivered to the former President or his designated
    representative.
      (b) Upon the passage of 30 days after receipt by the incumbent
    and former Presidents of a notice of intent to disclose
    Presidential records, the Archivist may disclose the records
    covered by the notice, unless during that time period the Archivist
    has received a claim of executive privilege by the incumbent or
    former President or the Archivist has been instructed by the
    incumbent President or his designee to extend the time period for a
    time certain and with reason for the extension of time provided in
    the notice. If a shorter period of time is required under the
    circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations,
    the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.
      Sec. 3. Claim of Executive Privilege by Incumbent President. (a)
    Upon receipt of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential
    records, the Attorney General (directly or through the Assistant
    Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel
    to the President shall review as they deem appropriate the records
    covered by the notice and consult with each other, the Archivist,
    and such other executive agencies as they deem appropriate
    concerning whether invocation of executive privilege is justified.
      (b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the
    exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and
    consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly
    determine that invocation of executive privilege is not justified.
    The Archivist shall be notified promptly of any such determination.
      (c) If either the Attorney General or the Counsel to the
    President believes that the circumstances justify invocation of
    executive privilege, the issue shall be presented to the President
    by the Counsel to the President and the Attorney General.
      (d) If the President decides to invoke executive privilege, the
    Counsel to the President shall notify the former President, the
    Archivist, and the Attorney General in writing of the claim of
    privilege and the specific Presidential records to which it
    relates. After receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not
    disclose the privileged records unless directed to do so by an
    incumbent President or by a final court order.
      Sec. 4. Claim of Executive Privilege by Former President. (a)
    Upon receipt of a claim of executive privilege by a living former
    President, the Archivist shall consult with the Attorney General
    (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal
    Counsel), the Counsel to the President, and such other executive
    agencies as the Archivist deems appropriate concerning the
    Archivist's determination as to whether to honor the former
    President's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the
    Presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege. Any
    determination under section 3 of this order that executive
    privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent President shall not
    prejudice the Archivist's determination with respect to the former
    President's claim of privilege.
      (b) In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) of
    this section, the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given
    him by the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise
    directed by a final court order. The Archivist shall notify the
    incumbent and former Presidents of his determination at least 30
    days prior to disclosure of the Presidential records, unless a
    shorter time period is required in the circumstances set forth in
    section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations. Copies of the notice for
    the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President
    (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney General
    (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal
    Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be
    delivered to the former President or his designated representative.
      Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be
    construed to impair or otherwise affect:
        (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the
      head thereof; or
        (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative
      proposals.
      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
    law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      Sec. 6. Revocation. Executive Order 13233 of November 1, 2001, is
    revoked.

-EXEC-
                        MANAGING GOVERNMENT RECORDS                    
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Nov. 28, 2011, 76
    F.R. 75423, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
      Section 1. Purpose. This memorandum begins an executive branch-
    wide effort to reform records management policies and practices.
    Improving records management will improve performance and promote
    openness and accountability by better documenting agency actions
    and decisions. Records transferred to the National Archives and
    Records Administration (NARA) provide the prism through which
    future generations will understand and learn from our actions and
    decisions. Modernized records management will also help executive
    departments and agencies (agencies) minimize costs and operate more
    efficiently. Improved records management thus builds on Executive
    Order 13589 of November 9, 2011 (Promoting Efficient Spending),
    which directed agencies to reduce spending and focus on mission-
    critical functions.
      When records are well-managed, agencies can use them to assess
    the impact of programs, to reduce redundant efforts, to save money,
    and to share knowledge within and across their organizations. In
    these ways, proper records management is the backbone of open
    Government.
      Decades of technological advances have transformed agency
    operations, creating challenges and opportunities for agency
    records management. Greater reliance on electronic communication
    and systems has radically increased the volume and diversity of
    information that agencies must manage. With proper planning,
    technology can make these records less burdensome to manage and
    easier to use and share. But if records management policies and
    practices are not updated for a digital age, the surge in
    information could overwhelm agency systems, leading to higher costs
    and lost records.
      We must address these challenges while using the opportunity to
    develop a 21st-century framework for the management of Government
    records. This framework will provide a foundation for open
    Government, leverage information to improve agency performance, and
    reduce unnecessary costs and burdens.
      Sec. 2. Agency Commitments to Records Management Reform. (a) The
    head of each agency shall:
      (i) ensure that the successful implementation of records
    management requirements in law, regulation, and this memorandum is
    a priority for senior agency management;
      (ii) ensure that proper resources are allocated to the effective
    implementation of such requirements; and
      (iii) within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, designate in
    writing to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), a senior
    agency official to supervise the review required by subsection (b)
    of this section, in coordination with the agency's Records Officer,
    Chief Information Officer, and General Counsel.
      (b) Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, each agency
    head shall submit a report to the Archivist and the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that:
      (i) describes the agency's current plans for improving or
    maintaining its records management program, particularly with
    respect to managing electronic records, including email and social
    media, deploying cloud-based services or storage solutions, and
    meeting other records challenges;
      (ii) identifies any provisions, or omissions, in relevant
    statutes, regulations, or official NARA guidance that currently
    pose an obstacle to the agency's adoption of sound, cost-effective
    records management policies and practices; and
      (iii) identifies policies or programs that, if included in the
    Records Management Directive required by section 3 of this
    memorandum or adopted or implemented by NARA, would assist the
    agency's efforts to improve records management.
    The reports submitted pursuant to this subsection should
    supplement, and therefore need not duplicate, information provided
    by agencies to NARA pursuant to other reporting obligations.
      Sec. 3. Records Management Directive. (a) Within 120 days of the
    deadline for reports submitted pursuant to section 2(b) of this
    memorandum, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination
    with the Associate Attorney General, shall issue a Records
    Management Directive that directs agency heads to take specific
    steps to reform and improve records management policies and
    practices within their agency. The directive shall focus on:
      (i) creating a Government-wide records management framework that
    is more efficient and cost-effective;
      (ii) promoting records management policies and practices that
    enhance the capability of agencies to fulfill their statutory
    missions;
      (iii) maintaining accountability through documentation of agency
    actions;
      (iv) increasing open Government and appropriate public access to
    Government records;
      (v) supporting agency compliance with applicable legal
    requirements related to the preservation of information relevant to
    litigation; and
      (vi) transitioning from paper-based records management to
    electronic records management where feasible.
      (b) In the course of developing the directive, the Archivist, in
    coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney
    General, shall review relevant statutes, regulations, and official
    NARA guidance to identify opportunities for reforms that would
    facilitate improved Government-wide records management practices,
    particularly with respect to electronic records. The Archivist, in
    coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney
    General, shall present to the President the results of this review,
    no later than the date of the directive's issuance, to facilitate
    potential updates to the laws, regulations, and policies governing
    the management of Federal records.
      (c) In developing the directive, the Director of OMB and the
    Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General,
    shall consult with other affected agencies, interagency groups, and
    public stakeholders.
      Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This memorandum shall be
    implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the
    availability of appropriations.
      (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or
    otherwise affect:
      (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the
    head thereof; or
      (ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary,
    administrative, or legislative proposals.
      (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
    right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
    in equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      Sec. 5. Publication. The Archivist is hereby authorized and
    directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3303a. Examination by Archivist of lists and schedules of
      records lacking preservation value; disposal of records

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Archivist shall examine the lists and schedules submitted
    to him under section 3303 of this title. If the Archivist
    determines that any of the records listed in a list or schedule
    submitted to him do not, or will not after the lapse of the period
    specified, have sufficient administrative, legal, research, or
    other value to warrant their continued preservation by the
    Government, he may, after publication of notice in the Federal
    Register and an opportunity for interested persons to submit
    comment thereon - 
        (1) notify the agency to that effect; and
        (2) empower the agency to dispose of those records in
      accordance with regulations promulgated under section 3302 of
      this title.

      (b) Authorizations granted under lists and schedules submitted to
    the Archivist under section 3303 of this title, and schedules
    promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (d) of this section,
    shall be mandatory, subject to section 2909 of this title. As
    between an authorization granted under lists and schedules
    submitted to the Archivist under section 3303 of this title and an
    authorization contained in a schedule promulgated under subsection
    (d) of this section, application of the authorization providing for
    the shorter retention period shall be required, subject to section
    2909 of this title.
      (c) The Archivist may request advice and counsel from the
    Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate and the
    Committee on House Oversight of the House of Representatives with
    respect to the disposal of any particular records under this
    chapter whenever he considers that - 
        (1) those particular records may be of special interest to the
      Congress; or
        (2) consultation with the Congress regarding the disposal of
      those particular records is in the public interest.

    However, this subsection does not require the Archivist to request
    such advice and counsel as a regular procedure in the general
    disposal of records under this chapter.
      (d) The Archivist shall promulgate schedules authorizing the
    disposal, after the lapse of specified periods of time, of records
    of a specified form or character common to several or all agencies
    if such records will not, at the end of the periods specified, have
    sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to
    warrant their further preservation by the United States Government.
      (e) The Archivist may approve and effect the disposal of records
    that are in his legal custody, provided that records that had been
    in the custody of another existing agency may not be disposed of
    without the written consent of the head of the agency.
      (f) The Archivist shall make an annual report to the Congress
    concerning the disposal of records under this chapter, including
    general descriptions of the types of records disposed of and such
    other information as he considers appropriate to keep the Congress
    fully informed regarding the disposal of records under this
    chapter.

-STATUTE-
      During a state of war between the United States and another

    the head of an agency of the United States Government may authorize
    the destruction of records in his legal custody situated in a
    military or naval establishment, ship, or other depository outside
    the territorial limits of continental United States - 
        (1) the retention of which would be prejudicial to the
      interests of the United States or
        (2) which occupy space urgently needed for military purposes
      and are, in his opinion, without sufficient administrative,
      legal, research, or other value to warrant their continued
      preservation.

    Within six months after their disposal, the official who directed
    the disposal shall submit a written report to the Archivist in
    which he shall describe the character of the records and state when
    and where he disposed of them.

             "SUBTITLE A - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PROTECTION         

      "SEC. 511. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have
      varying degrees of legal protection when providing information to
      the agencies for strictly statistical purposes.
        "(2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide assurances
      to the public that information about individuals or organizations
      or provided by individuals or organizations for exclusively
      statistical purposes will be held in confidence and will not be
      used against such individuals or organizations in any agency
      action.
        "(3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of individuals or
      organizations who provide information under a pledge of
      confidentiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the
      interests of the public and the needs of society.
        "(4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of
      information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the
      agencies adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness of
      statistical analyses.
        "(5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of
      confidentiality for statistical purposes receives protection is
      essential in continuing public cooperation in statistical
      programs.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this subtitle are the following:
        "(1) To ensure that information supplied by individuals or
      organizations to an agency for statistical purposes under a
      pledge of confidentiality is used exclusively for statistical
      purposes.
        "(2) To ensure that individuals or organizations who supply
      information under a pledge of confidentiality to agencies for
      statistical purposes will neither have that information disclosed
      in identifiable form to anyone not authorized by this title nor
      have that information used for any purpose other than a
      statistical purpose.
        "(3) To safeguard the confidentiality of individually
      identifiable information acquired under a pledge of
      confidentiality for statistical purposes by controlling access
      to, and uses made of, such information.

      "SEC. 512. LIMITATIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA AND
        INFORMATION.
      "(a) Use of Statistical Data or Information. - Data or
    information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality
    and for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by officers,
    employees, or agents of the agency exclusively for statistical
    purposes.
      "(b) Disclosure of Statistical Data or Information. - 
        "(1) Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge
      of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall not
      be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use other
      than an exclusively statistical purpose, except with the informed
      consent of the respondent.
        "(2) A disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1) is authorized only
      when the head of the agency approves such disclosure and the
      disclosure is not prohibited by any other law.
        "(3) This section does not restrict or diminish any
      confidentiality protections in law that otherwise apply to data
      or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of
      confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes.
      "(c) Rule for Use of Data or Information for Nonstatistical
    Purposes. - A statistical agency or unit shall clearly distinguish
    any data or information it collects for nonstatistical purposes (as
    authorized by law) and provide notice to the public, before the
    data or information is collected, that the data or information
    could be used for nonstatistical purposes.
      "(d) Designation of Agents. - A statistical agency or unit may
    designate agents, by contract or by entering into a special
    agreement containing the provisions required under section 502(2)
    for treatment as an agent under that section, who may perform
    exclusively statistical activities, subject to the limitations and
    penalties described in this title.

      "SEC. 513. FINES AND PENALTIES.
      "Whoever, being an officer, employee, or agent of an agency
    acquiring information for exclusively statistical purposes, having
    taken and subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe
    the limitations imposed by section 512, comes into possession of
    such information by reason of his or her being an officer,
    employee, or agent and, knowing that the disclosure of the specific
    information is prohibited under the provisions of this title,
    willfully discloses the information in any manner to a person or
    agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a class E
    felony and imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or fined not more
    than $250,000, or both.

                   "SUBTITLE B - STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY               

      "SEC. 521. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
      "(a) Findings. - The Congress finds the following:
        "(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information
      for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers,
      consumers, businesses, investors, and workers.
        "(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to
      improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability
      of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher
      efficiency for Federal statistical programs.
        "(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the
      willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys.
      Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and
      therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.
        "(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the
      Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor
      Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve
      their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly
      changing nature of United States business. In particular, the
      statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that
      businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries,
      resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are
      consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in
      a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and
      efficiently.
        "(5) The Congress enacted the International Investment and
      Trade in Services Act of 1990 [probably means the International
      Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, Pub. L. 94-472, as
      amended by Pub. L. 101-533, which is classified to 22 U.S.C. 3101
      et seq.] that allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of
      Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share
      data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded
      detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800
      industries with no increase in the data collected from
      respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in
      the creation of valuable data products.
        "(6) With subtitle A of this title, the sharing of business
      data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic
      Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure
      the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to
      statistical surveys.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this subtitle are the following:
        "(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the Bureau
      of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of
      Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes.
        "(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses that
      provide requested information to the Federal Government.
        "(3) To improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal
      economic statistics by allowing the Bureau of the Census, the
      Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics
      to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of
      establishments and companies into industries, improve coverage,
      and reconcile significant differences in data produced by the
      three agencies.
        "(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy,
      especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop
      more accurate measures of the impact of technology on
      productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the
      Nation's most important economic indicators, such as the National
      Income and Product Accounts.

          EX. ORD. NO. 13556. CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION      
      Ex. Ord. No. 13556, Nov. 4, 2010, 75 F.R. 68675, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered
    as follows:
      Section 1. Purpose. This order establishes an open and uniform
    program for managing information that requires safeguarding or
    dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law,
    regulations, and Government-wide policies, excluding information
    that is classified under Executive Order 13526 of December 29,
    2009, or the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.
      At present, executive departments and agencies (agencies) employ
    ad hoc, agency-specific policies, procedures, and markings to
    safeguard and control this information, such as information that
    involves privacy, security, proprietary business interests, and law
    enforcement investigations. This inefficient, confusing patchwork
    has resulted in inconsistent marking and safeguarding of documents,
    led to unclear or unnecessarily restrictive dissemination policies,
    and created impediments to authorized information sharing. The fact
    that these agency-specific policies are often hidden from public
    view has only aggravated these issues.
      To address these problems, this order establishes a program for
    managing this information, hereinafter described as Controlled
    Unclassified Information, that emphasizes the openness and
    uniformity of Government-wide practice.
      Sec. 2. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
      (a) The CUI categories and subcategories shall serve as exclusive
    designations for identifying unclassified information throughout
    the executive branch that requires safeguarding or dissemination
    controls, pursuant to and consistent with applicable law,
    regulations, and Government-wide policies.
      (b) The mere fact that information is designated as CUI shall not
    have a bearing on determinations pursuant to any law requiring the
    disclosure of information or permitting disclosure as a matter of
    discretion, including disclosures to the legislative or judicial
    branches.
      (c) The National Archives and Records Administration shall serve
    as the Executive Agent to implement this order and oversee agency
    actions to ensure compliance with this order.
      Sec. 3. Review of Current Designations.
      (a) Each agency head shall, within 180 days of the date of this
    order:
      (1) review all categories, subcategories, and markings used by
    the agency to designate unclassified information for safeguarding
    or dissemination controls; and
      (2) submit to the Executive Agent a catalogue of proposed
    categories and subcategories of CUI, and proposed associated
    markings for information designated as CUI under section 2(a) of
    this order. This submission shall provide definitions for each
    proposed category and subcategory and identify the basis in law,
    regulation, or Government-wide policy for safeguarding or
    dissemination controls.
      (b) If there is significant doubt about whether information
    should be designated as CUI, it shall not be so designated.
      Sec. 4. Development of CUI Categories and Policies.
      (a) On the basis of the submissions under section 3 of this order
    or future proposals, and in consultation with affected agencies,
    the Executive Agent shall, in a timely manner, approve categories
    and subcategories of CUI and associated markings to be applied
    uniformly throughout the executive branch and to become effective
    upon publication in the registry established under subsection (d)
    of this section. No unclassified information meeting the
    requirements of section 2(a) of this order shall be disapproved for
    inclusion as CUI, but the Executive Agent may resolve conflicts
    among categories and subcategories of CUI to achieve uniformity and
    may determine the markings to be used.
      (b) The Executive Agent, in consultation with affected agencies,
    shall develop and issue such directives as are necessary to
    implement this order. Such directives shall be made available to
    the public and shall provide policies and procedures concerning
    marking, safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol of CUI that, to
    the extent practicable and permitted by law, regulation, and
    Government-wide policies, shall remain consistent across categories
    and subcategories of CUI and throughout the executive branch. In
    developing such directives, appropriate consideration should be
    given to the report of the interagency Task Force on Controlled
    Unclassified Information published in August 2009. The Executive
    Agent shall issue initial directives for the implementation of this
    order within 180 days of the date of this order.
      (c) The Executive Agent shall convene and chair interagency
    meetings to discuss matters pertaining to the program established
    by this order.
      (d) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Executive Agent
    shall establish and maintain a public CUI registry reflecting
    authorized CUI categories and subcategories, associated markings,
    and applicable safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol
    procedures.
      (e) If the Executive Agent and an agency cannot reach agreement
    on an issue related to the implementation of this order, that issue
    may be appealed to the President through the Director of the Office
    of Management and Budget.
      (f) In performing its functions under this order, the Executive
    Agent, in accordance with applicable law, shall consult with
    representatives of the public and State, local, tribal, and private
    sector partners on matters related to approving categories and
    subcategories of CUI and developing implementing directives issued
    by the Executive Agent pursuant to this order.
      Sec. 5. Implementation.
      (a) Within 180 days of the issuance of initial policies and
    procedures by the Executive Agent in accordance with section 4(b)
    of this order, each agency that originates or handles CUI shall
    provide the Executive Agent with a proposed plan for compliance
    with the requirements of this order, including the establishment of
    interim target dates.
      (b) After a review of agency plans, and in consultation with
    affected agencies and the Office of Management and Budget, the
    Executive Agent shall establish deadlines for phased implementation
    by agencies.
      (c) In each of the first 5 years following the date of this order
    and biennially thereafter, the Executive Agent shall publish a
    report on the status of agency implementation of this order.
      Sec. 6. General Provisions.
      (a) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with:
      (1) applicable law, including protections of confidentiality and
    privacy rights;
      (2) the statutory authority of the heads of agencies, including
    authorities related to the protection of information provided by
    the private sector to the Federal Government; and
      (3) applicable Government-wide standards and guidelines issued by
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and applicable
    policies established by the Office of Management and Budget.
      (b) The Director of National Intelligence (Director), with
    respect to the Intelligence Community and after consultation with
    the heads of affected agencies, may issue such policy directives
    and guidelines as the Director deems necessary to implement this
    order with respect to intelligence and intelligence-related
    information. Procedures or other guidance issued by Intelligence
    Community element heads shall be in accordance with such policy
    directives or guidelines issued by the Director. Any such policy
    directives or guidelines issued by the Director shall be in
    accordance with this order and directives issued by the Executive
    Agent.
      (c) This order shall not be construed to impair or otherwise
    affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management
    and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, and legislative
    proposals.
      (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      (e) This order shall be implemented subject to the availability
    of appropriations.
      (f) The Attorney General, upon request by the head of an agency
    or the Executive Agent, shall render an interpretation of this
    order with respect to any question arising in the course of its

       MAKING IT EASIER FOR AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESSES AND AMERICA'S
    EXPORTERS TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO HELP THEM GROW AND HIRE
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 2011, 76
    F.R. 68049, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
      As I outlined in my State of the Union address to the Congress on
    January 25, 2011, winning the future in the global economy will
    require a Government that wisely allocates its scarce resources to
    maximize efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support
    American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. If we are to
    thrive in the global economy, and make America the best place on
    Earth to do business, we need to equip our Government with the
    tools necessary to support innovation and job growth in the 21st
    century.
      Accordingly, we must make it easier for businesses to access the
    full range of Government programs and services without having to
    waste effort navigating their way through the Federal bureaucracy.
    At the same time, we must further streamline and coordinate Federal
    programs to reduce costs and provide customer-oriented service.
      Businesses looking for assistance from the Federal Government
    should feel like they are interacting with one entity, rather than
    a number of separate, albeit linked, components. This means
    adopting a "No Wrong Door" policy that uses technology to quickly
    connect businesses to the services and information relevant to
    them, regardless of which agency's website, call center, or office
    they go to for help.
      In addition, a business's interactions with the Federal
    Government should be individualized and efficient. If the private
    sector can allow consumers to customize interactions so that they
    receive only the information they want, in the form they want it,
    so can the Federal Government.
      Today, I am directing a first wave of changes focused on both
    small businesses and businesses of all sizes that want to begin or
    increase exporting (exporters), because those businesses help drive
    economic growth and have the most to gain from Federal assistance.
    We plan to use the resulting improvements as a model for future
    reforms so that, in time, all businesses and all citizens receive
    the highest level of customer service when they interact with the
    Federal Government.
      Accordingly, I direct the following:
      (1) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall work
    with a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Federal Chief
    Information Officer, Assistant to the President and Chief
    Technology Officer, and Chief Performance Officer (the Co-Chairs)
    to carry out the directives in this memorandum within 90 days of
    the date of this memorandum, unless a provision of this memorandum
    expressly states otherwise. The Steering Committee shall include
    senior policy and technical representatives, appointed by the heads
    of their respective agencies, from the Departments of State,
    Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, and Veterans Affairs, the Small
    Business Administration (SBA), the General Services Administration
    (GSA), the Export-Import Bank, and other agencies designated by the
    Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs and representatives from the Department of
    Commerce and SBA shall serve as the Executive Committee of the
    Steering Committee, which shall coordinate the strategy, design,
    development, launch, and operation of BusinessUSA, a common, open,
    online platform and web service with dedicated resources that will,
    as a first step, disseminate core information regarding the Federal
    Government's programs and services relevant to small businesses and
    exporters.
      (2) Agencies shall work with the Steering Committee to develop
    and launch an introductory version of BusinessUSA. BusinessUSA
    shall be designed, tested, and built with the active feedback of
    U.S. businesses and relevant online communities. To the extent
    appropriate, practicable, and permitted by law, the BusinessUSA
    platform shall integrate related State and local government
    services as well as those of private sector partners.
      (3) Agencies shall make information regarding their small
    business and export programs and services accessible through
    BusinessUSA. To accomplish this in a uniform fashion, the Steering
    Committee shall develop a common set of standards for content
    available through BusinessUSA, which shall identify the types of
    programs and services to be included initially on BusinessUSA and a
    structure for organizing and presenting such information. These
    standards shall be used by all agencies in the creation,
    presentation, and delivery of information regarding their programs
    and services, to the extent practicable and permitted by law.
      (4) Agencies shall also work with the Steering Committee to
    develop new content for BusinessUSA that synthesizes information
    available across agencies to better serve small businesses and
    exporters. Among other things, agencies shall work together to
    aggregate on the BusinessUSA platform statistical, demographic, and
    other raw Government datasets of particular interest to small
    businesses and exporters, making Government data more easily
    accessible and spurring innovative uses of the data through
    business-oriented web or mobile applications.
      (5) Agencies shall integrate BusinessUSA, including ready access
    to the BusinessUSA website, into their current websites, call
    centers, and field offices to ensure that small businesses and
    exporters have access to the wide range of Government programs and
    services at each entry point into the Federal Government. During
    the year following the date of this memorandum, agencies shall work
    with GSA and the Office of Management and Budget to enhance the
    centralized call center for responding to public questions about
    Federal programs and services (1-800-FED-INFO) to add expertise
    with Government programs and services for small businesses and
    exporters.
      (6) (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair
    or otherwise affect:
        (i) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency,
      or the head thereof; or
        (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
      proposals.
      (b) BusinessUSA shall be operated by a single hosting agency
    under the Executive Committee's coordination. To the extent
    permitted by law, agencies shall reimburse the hosting agency for
    the cost of establishing, maintaining, and operating BusinessUSA.
      (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with
    applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any
    right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
    in equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      (7) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is
    authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal
    Register.
                                                           Barack Obama.

-EXEC-
                 EX. ORD. NO. 13073. YEAR 2000 CONVERSION             
      Ex. Ord. No. 13073, Feb. 4, 1998, 63 F.R. 6467, as amended by Ex.
    Ord. No. 13127, June 14, 1999, 64 F.R. 32793, provided:
      The American people expect reliable service from their Government
    and deserve the confidence that critical government functions
    dependent on electronic systems will be performed accurately and in
    a timely manner. Because of a design feature in many electronic
    systems, a large number of activities in the public and private
    sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer
    systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year
    "00" as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless appropriate action is taken,
    this flaw, known as the "Y2K problem," can cause systems that
    support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run.
    Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and
    managerial effort, and it is critical that the United States
    Government do its part in addressing this challenge.
      Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. (a) It shall be the policy of the executive
    branch that agencies shall:
      (1) assure that no critical Federal program experiences
    disruption because of the Y2K problem;
      (2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and tribal
    governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments
    depend on Federal information or information technology or the
    Federal Government is dependent on those governments to perform
    critical missions;
      (3) cooperate with the private sector operators of critical
    national and local systems, including the banking and financial
    system, the telecommunications system, the public health system,
    the transportation system, and the electric power generation
    system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and
      (4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to raise
    awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to
    address the Y2K problem.
      (b) As used in this order, "agency" and "agencies" refer to
    Federal agencies that are not in the judicial or legislative
    branches.
      Sec. 2. Year 2000 Conversion Council. There is hereby established
    the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion (the "Council").
      (a) The Council shall be led by a Chair who shall be an Assistant
    to the President, and it shall be composed of one representative
    from each of the executive departments and from such other Federal
    agencies as may be determined by the Chair of the Council (the
    "Chair").
      (b) The Chair shall appoint a Vice Chair and assign other
    responsibilities for operations of the council as he or she deems
    necessary.
      (c) The Chair shall oversee the activities of agencies to assure
    that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000, act as
    chief spokesperson on this issue for the executive branch in
    national and international fora, provide policy coordination of
    executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal
    governments on the Y2K problem, and promote appropriate Federal
    roles with respect to private sector activities in this area.
      (d) The Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget shall report jointly at least quarterly to me on the
    progress of agencies in addressing the Y2K problem.
      (e) The Chair shall identify such resources from agencies as the
    Chair deems necessary for the implementation of the policies set
    out in this order, consistent with applicable law.
      Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. (a) The head of each
    agency shall:
      (1) assure that efforts to address the Y2K problem receive the
    highest priority attention in the agency and that the policies
    established in this order are carried out; and
      (2) cooperate to the fullest extent with the Chair by making
    available such information, support, and assistance, including
    personnel, as the Chair may request to support the accomplishment
    of the tasks assigned herein, consistent with applicable law.
      (b) The heads of executive departments and the agencies
    designated by the Chair under section 2(a) of this order shall
    identify a responsible official to represent the head of the
    executive department or agency on the Council with sufficient
    authority and experience to commit agency resources to address the
    Y2K problem.
      Sec. 4. Responsibilities of Interagency and Executive Office
    Councils. Interagency councils and councils within the Executive
    Office of the President, including the President's Management
    Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief
    Financial Officers Council, the President's Council on Integrity
    and Efficiency, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency,
    the National Science and Technology Council, the National
    Performance Review, the National Economic Council, the Domestic
    Policy Council, and the National Security Council shall provide
    assistance and support to the Chair upon the Chair's request.
      Sec. 5. Information Coordination Center. (a) To assist the Chair
    in the Y2K response duties included under section 2(c) of this
    order, there shall be established the Information Coordination
    Center (ICC) in the General Services Administration.
      (b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will assist in making
    preparations for information sharing and coordination within the
    Federal Government and key components of the public and private
    sectors, coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that
    could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home and abroad,
    and, if necessary, assisting Federal agencies and the Chair in
    reconstitution processes where appropriate.
      (c) The ICC will:
      (1) consist of officials from executive agencies, designated by
    agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of this order, who have
    expertise in important management and technical areas, computer
    hardware, software or security systems, reconstitution and
    recovery, and of additional personnel hired directly or by
    contract, as required, to carry out the duties described under
    section 5 of this order;
      (2) work with the Council and the Office of Management and Budget
    to assure that Federal efforts to restore critical systems are
    coordinated with efforts managed by Federal agencies acting under
    existing emergency response authorities.
      (d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion
    shall designate a Director of the ICC.
      Sec. 6. Judicial Review. This Executive order is intended only to
    improve the internal management of the executive branch and does
    not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural,
    enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States,
    its agencies, or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or
    any other person.

      specifically authorized under criteria established by an
      Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the
      interest of national defense or foreign policy; or
        (B) any communication relating to a collection of information
      which is not approved under this subchapter, the disclosure of
      which could lead to retaliation or discrimination against the
      communicator.

      (f)(1) An independent regulatory agency which is administered by
    2 or more members of a commission, board, or similar body, may by
    majority vote void - 
        (A) any disapproval by the Director, in whole or in part, of a
      proposed collection of information of that agency; or
        (B) an exercise of authority under subsection (d) of section
      3507 concerning that agency.

      (2) The agency shall certify each vote to void such disapproval
    or exercise to the Director, and explain the reasons for such vote.
    The Director shall without further delay assign a control number to
    such collection of information, and such vote to void the
    disapproval or exercise shall be valid for a period of 3 years.
      (g) The Director may not approve a collection of information for
    a period in excess of 3 years.
      (h)(1) If an agency decides to seek extension of the Director's
    approval granted for a currently approved collection of
    information, the agency shall - 
        (A) conduct the review established under section 3506(c),
      including the seeking of comment from the public on the continued
      need for, and burden imposed by the collection of information;
      and
        (B) after having made a reasonable effort to seek public
      comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of
      the control number assigned by the Director for the currently
      approved collection of information, submit the collection of
      information for review and approval under this section, which
      shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the
      information that it has collected.

      (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director
    disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing
    rule, or recommends or instructs the agency to make a substantive
    or material change to a collection of information contained in an
    existing rule, the Director shall - 
        (A) publish an explanation thereof in the Federal Register; and
        (B) instruct the agency to undertake a rulemaking within a
      reasonable time limited to consideration of changes to the
      collection of information contained in the rule and thereafter to
      submit the collection of information for approval or disapproval
      under this subchapter.

      (3) An agency may not make a substantive or material modification
    to a collection of information after such collection has been
    approved by the Director, unless the modification has been
    submitted to the Director for review and approval under this
    subchapter.
      (i)(1) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency
    designated under section 3506(a) is sufficiently independent of
    program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed
    collections of information should be approved and has sufficient
    resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the
    Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment
    provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to
    such official the authority to approve proposed collections of
    information in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or
    for all agency purposes.
      (2) A delegation by the Director under this section shall not
    preclude the Director from reviewing individual collections of
    information if the Director determines that circumstances warrant
    such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such
    delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific
    matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval
    authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully
    with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.
      (j)(1) The agency head may request the Director to authorize a
    collection of information, if an agency head determines that - 
        (A) a collection of information - 
          (i) is needed prior to the expiration of time periods
        established under this subchapter; and
          (ii) is essential to the mission of the agency; and

        (B) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of
      this subchapter because - 
          (i) public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal
        clearance procedures are followed;
          (ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or
          (iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably
        likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or
        is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered
        deadline to be missed.

      (2) The Director shall approve or disapprove any such
    authorization request within the time requested by the agency head
    and, if approved, shall assign the collection of information a
    control number. Any collection of information conducted under this
    subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions
    of this subchapter for a maximum of 180 days after the date on
    which the Director received the request to authorize such
    collection.

-STATUTE-
      The Director may designate a central collection agency to obtain
    information for two or more agencies if the Director determines
    that the needs of such agencies for information will be adequately
    served by a single collection agency, and such sharing of data is
    not inconsistent with applicable law. In such cases the Director
    shall prescribe (with reference to the collection of information)
    the duties and functions of the collection agency so designated and
    of the agencies for which it is to act as agent (including
    reimbursement for costs). While the designation is in effect, an
    agency covered by the designation may not obtain for itself
    information for the agency which is the duty of the collection
    agency to obtain. The Director may modify the designation from time
    to time as circumstances require. The authority to designate under
    this section is subject to the provisions of section 3507(f) of
    this subchapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 3520. Establishment of task force on information collection
      and dissemination

-STATUTE-
      (a) There is established a task force to study the feasibility of
    streamlining requirements with respect to small business concerns
    regarding collection of information and strengthening dissemination
    of information (in this section referred to as the "task force").
      (b)(1) The Director shall determine - 
        (A) subject to the minimum requirements under paragraph (2),
      the number of representatives to be designated under each
      subparagraph of that paragraph; and
        (B) the agencies to be represented under paragraph (2)(K).

      (2) After all determinations are made under paragraph (1), the
    members of the task force shall be designated by the head of each
    applicable department or agency, and include - 
        (A) 1 representative of the Director, who shall convene and
      chair the task force;
        (B) not less than 2 representatives of the Department of Labor,
      including 1 representative of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and
      1 representative of the Occupational Safety and Health
      Administration;

      Administration; and
        (K) not less than 1 representative of each of 2 agencies not
      represented by representatives described under subparagraphs (A)
      through (J).

      (c) The task force shall - 
        (1) identify ways to integrate the collection of information
      across Federal agencies and programs and examine the feasibility
      and desirability of requiring each agency to consolidate
      requirements regarding collections of information with respect to
      small business concerns within and across agencies, without
      negatively impacting the effectiveness of underlying laws and
      regulations regarding such collections of information, in order
      that each small business concern may submit all information
      required by the agency - 
          (A) to 1 point of contact in the agency;
          (B) in a single format, such as a single electronic reporting
        system, with respect to the agency; and
          (C) with synchronized reporting for information submissions
        having the same frequency, such as synchronized quarterly,
        semiannual, and annual reporting dates;

        (2) examine the feasibility and benefits to small businesses of
      publishing a list by the Director of the collections of
      information applicable to small business concerns (as defined in
      section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), organized -
      
          (A) by North American Industry Classification System code;
          (B) by industrial sector description; or
          (C) in another manner by which small business concerns can
        more easily identify requirements with which those small
        business concerns are expected to comply;

        (3) examine the savings, including cost savings, and develop
      recommendations for implementing - 
          (A) systems for electronic submissions of information to the
        Federal Government; and
          (B) interactive reporting systems, including components that
        provide immediate feedback to assure that data being submitted -
         
            (i) meet requirements of format; and
            (ii) are within the range of acceptable options for each
          data field;

        (4) make recommendations to improve the electronic
      dissemination of information collected under Federal
      requirements;
        (5) recommend a plan for the development of an interactive
      Governmentwide system, available through the Internet, to allow
      each small business to - 
          (A) better understand which Federal requirements regarding
        collection of information (and, when possible, which other
        Federal regulatory requirements) apply to that particular
        business; and
          (B) more easily comply with those Federal requirements; and

        (6) in carrying out this section, consider opportunities for
      the coordination - 
          (A) of Federal and State reporting requirements; and
          (B) among the points of contact described under section
        3506(i), such as to enable agencies to provide small business
        concerns with contacts for information collection requirements
        for other agencies.

      (d) The task force shall - 
        (1) by publication in the Federal Register, provide notice and
      an opportunity for public comment on each report in draft form;
      and
        (2) make provision in each report for the inclusion of - 
          (A) any additional or dissenting views of task force members;
        and
          (B) a summary of significant public comments.

        (3) the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement
      Ombudsman designated under section 30(b) of the Small Business
      Act (15 U.S.C. 657(b)).

-STATUTE-
      The purposes of this subchapter are to - 
        (1) provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the
      effectiveness of information security controls over information
      resources that support Federal operations and assets;
        (2) recognize the highly networked nature of the current
      Federal computing environment and provide effective
      governmentwide management and oversight of the related
      information security risks, including coordination of information
      security efforts throughout the civilian, national security, and
      law enforcement communities;
        (3) provide for development and maintenance of minimum controls
      required to protect Federal information and information systems;
        (4) provide a mechanism for improved oversight of Federal
      agency information security programs;
        (5) acknowledge that commercially developed information
      security products offer advanced, dynamic, robust, and effective
      information security solutions, reflecting market solutions for
      the protection of critical information infrastructures important
      to the national defense and economic security of the nation that
      are designed, built, and operated by the private sector; and
        (6) recognize that the selection of specific technical hardware
      and software information security solutions should be left to
      individual agencies from among commercially developed products.

-STATUTE-
      The purposes of this subchapter are to - 
        (1) provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the
      effectiveness of information security controls over information
      resources that support Federal operations and assets;
        (2) recognize the highly networked nature of the current
      Federal computing environment and provide effective
      governmentwide management and oversight of the related
      information security risks, including coordination of information
      security efforts throughout the civilian, national security, and
      law enforcement communities;
        (3) provide for development and maintenance of minimum controls
      required to protect Federal information and information systems;
        (4) provide a mechanism for improved oversight of Federal
      agency information security programs;
        (5) acknowledge that commercially developed information
      security products offer advanced, dynamic, robust, and effective
      information security solutions, reflecting market solutions for
      the protection of critical information infrastructures important
      to the national defense and economic security of the nation that
      are designed, built, and operated by the private sector; and
        (6) recognize that the selection of specific technical hardware
      and software information security solutions should be left to
      individual agencies from among commercially developed products.

                           FINDINGS AND PURPOSES                       
      Pub. L. 107-347, Sec. 2, Dec. 17, 2002, 116 Stat. 2900, provided
    that:
      "(a) Findings. - Congress finds the following:
        "(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly
      transforming societal interactions and the relationships among
      citizens, private businesses, and the Government.
        "(2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in applying
      advances in information technology to enhance governmental
      functions and services, achieve more efficient performance,
      increase access to Government information, and increase citizen
      participation in Government.
        "(3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government are
      developed and presented separately, according to the
      jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or agency,
      rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function
      or topic.
        "(4) Internet-based Government services involving interagency
      cooperation are especially difficult to develop and promote, in
      part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to
      support such interagency cooperation.
        "(5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved
      Government performance and outcomes within and across agencies.
        "(6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the
      management of Government, to be implemented as part of a
      management framework that also addresses finance, procurement,
      human capital, and other challenges to improve the performance of
      Government.
        "(7) To take full advantage of the improved Government
      performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-
      based technology requires strong leadership, better
      organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more
      focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related to
      information resource management.
      "(b) Purposes. - The purposes of this Act [see Tables for
    classification] are the following:
        "(1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government
      efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services and
      processes by establishing an Administrator of a new Office of
      Electronic Government within the Office of Management and Budget.
        "(2) To promote use of the Internet and other information
      technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen
      participation in Government.
        "(3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing
      electronic Government services, where this collaboration would
      improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions,
      and in the use of internal electronic Government processes, where
      this collaboration would improve the efficiency and effectiveness
      of the processes.
        "(4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve agency
      missions and program performance goals.
        "(5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging
      technologies within and across Government agencies to provide
      citizen-centric Government information and services.
        "(6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other
      Government entities.
        "(7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy
      makers.
        "(8) To promote access to high quality Government information
      and services across multiple channels.
        "(9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and
      accountable.
        "(10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where
      appropriate, best practices from public and private sector
      organizations.
        "(11) To provide enhanced access to Government information and
      services in a manner consistent with laws regarding protection of
      personal privacy, national security, records retention, access
      for persons with disabilities, and other relevant laws."
