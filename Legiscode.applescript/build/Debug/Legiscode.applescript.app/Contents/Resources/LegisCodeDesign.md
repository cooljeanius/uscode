Goal: figure out how to write the language used in legislation into a programming language (LegisCode). Languages to use for inspiration:• LOLcode, for its top-down design philosophy of aiming to recreate a certain linguistic dialect programmatically as its primary goal, over and above any other concerns• AppleScript, for its natural language syntax• COBOL, for its large number of reserved words (***not*** for any other part of the language though)

There is also a “Hello World” example in this repository called "LegisCode.txt"
