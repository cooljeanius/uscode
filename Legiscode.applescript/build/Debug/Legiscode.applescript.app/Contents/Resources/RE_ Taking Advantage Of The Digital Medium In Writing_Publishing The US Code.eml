Subject: Taking Advantage Of The Digital Medium In Writing/Publishing The U=
S Code

Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Eric Gallager, and I am a student of political science at The Ge=
orge Washington University in Foggy Bottom and an intern on Capitol Hill. I=
 was recently looking at the US Code as published at http://uscodebeta.hous=
e.gov/, and I was struck by how much potential it had to be reformatted to =
take better advantage of the digital medium.

First of all, there's the issue of internal links<http://en.wikipedia.org/w=
iki/Internal_link>. I would expect that as the US Code is being published o=
nline, it would have a level of inter-linking at least comparable to that s=
een in Wikipedia<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia>. Laws constantly c=
ross-reference each other, and it is disappointing that even in the HTML ve=
rsion<http://uscodebeta.house.gov/download/downloadxhtml.shtml> (HTML being=
 the language of links), none of these cross-references actually link to th=
e other parts of the code they are cross-referencing (or if they do, it is =
neither obvious nor consistent).

Second, there is the issue of versioning<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versi=
oning_system>. The US legal code is constantly revised, and yet the way tha=
t revisions to it are handled online is done rather clumsily. MediaWiki<htt=
p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki> has an easy way of seeing changes betw=
een documents called diffs<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffs>, Microsoft W=
ord has had the "Track Changes"<http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help=
/track-changes-while-you-edit-HA001218690.aspx> feature built into it since=
 forever, and Mac OS X Lion<http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/auto-save=
.html> has a versioning system built into it at the OS level. Any of these =
could be an easier way to visualize changes to the US Code. Instead of havi=
ng to write out the procedural language to "Change line #x of =A7y to say z=
" in the legislation, with laws being written on software with a versioning=
 system, lawmakers could instead simply change the code to what they want t=
o amend it to, and then the changes would automatically show in the version=
ing system. Speaking of procedural language, that brings me to my third poi=
nt.

This proposal may be a little more ambitious than the previous two, but bea=
r with me. One thing about all the procedural language in legislation is th=
at it makes the legislation close to unreadable. So the idea I had, is what=
 if we change the procedural language of legislation into a Turing-complete=
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness> programming language? Th=
is way all the procedural language would be used for would be as a method o=
f organizing and displaying the actual content of the legislation. In other=
 words, the US Code would become actual computer "code." Based only on my m=
inimal knowledge of programming and procedural legislative language, I came=
 up with a possible way a "hello world" program<http://en.wikipedia.org/wik=
i/Hello_world_program> could look in a programming language based on US leg=
islation:

An Act To Say =93Hello World=94
Be It Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Stat=
es of America in Congress assembled,
=93hello world=94
Approved September 8, 2011

When compiled and run, the program/legislative act would simply say, "hello=
 world". It is clear how much this cuts down on the length of laws. Besides=
 making the displayed portions of the law more readable, making legislative=
 language into a programming language could have added benefits. For exampl=
e, by an act of legislation, Congress could require all computers to be abl=
e to compile and run this legislative programming language, and then if Con=
gress passes any future legislation regarding computers, it could automatic=
ally push that legislation out to all computers, where it would run automat=
ically. The government wouldn't even have to enforce cyber laws any more, b=
ecause they would automatically be enforced by being coded into everyone's =
computers. However, Congress doesn't have to go that far (I would also argu=
e that it shouldn't go that far either, but that's another issue). The bene=
fits of making legislative language into a programming language should be c=
lear by now. And if you have any doubts about the possibilities of turning =
natural language phrases into a programming language, I would simply point =
to LOLCODE<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE>, which took internet lingo=
 and turned it into a programming language. This sort of thing is definitel=
y possible.

So those are my 3 main proposals for bringing the US Legal Code into the 21=
st Century and taking full advantage of the digital medium: hyperlinking th=
e code, versioning the code, and turning the code into a programming langua=
ge. Honestly, if even just the first proposal were completed, I would be ha=
ppy, but I can still dream about the others. Thank you for your time and pl=
ease let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Eric Gallager
