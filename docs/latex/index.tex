lci is a L\-O\-L\-C\-O\-D\-E interpreter written in C and is designed to be correct, portable, fast, and precisely documented.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item correct\-: Every effort has been made to test lci's conformance to the L\-O\-L\-C\-O\-D\-E language specification. Unit tests come packaged with the lci source code.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item portable\-: lci follows the widely ported A\-N\-S\-I C specification allowing it to compile on a broad range of systems.
\item fast\-: Much effort has gone into producing simple and efficient code whenever possible to the extent that the above points are not compromized.
\item precisely documented\-: lci uses Doxygen to generate literate code documentation, browsable here.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_organization}{}\section{Organization}\label{index_organization}
lci employs several different modules which each perform a specific task during interpretation of code\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries lexer} (\hyperlink{lexer_8c_source}{lexer.\-c}, \hyperlink{lexer_8h}{lexer.\-h})-\/ The lexer takes an array of characters and splits it up into individual {\itshape lexemes\/}. Lexemes are divided by whitespace and other rules of the language.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries tokenizer} (\hyperlink{tokenizer_8c_source}{tokenizer.\-c}, \hyperlink{tokenizer_8h}{tokenizer.\-h}) -\/ The tokenizer takes the output of the lexer and converts it into individual {\itshape tokens\/}. Tokens are different from lexemes in that a single token may be made up of multiple lexemes. Also, the contents of some tokens are evaluated (such as integers and floats) for later use.
\item {\bfseries parser} (\hyperlink{parser_8c_source}{parser.\-c}, parser.\-h) -\/ The parser takes the output of the tokenizer and analyzes it semantically to turn it into a parse tree.
\item {\bfseries interpreter} (\hyperlink{interpreter_8c_source}{interpreter.\-c}, \hyperlink{interpreter_8h}{interpreter.\-h}) -\/ The interpreter takes the output of the parser and executes it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each of these modules is contained within its own C header and source code files of the same name.

To handle the conversion of Unicode code points and normative names to bytes, two additional files, \hyperlink{unicode_8c_source}{unicode.\-c} and \hyperlink{unicode_8h}{unicode.\-h} are used.

Finally, \hyperlink{main_8c_source}{main.\-c} ties all of these modules together and handles the initial loading of input data for the lexer.
